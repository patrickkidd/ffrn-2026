**Title:** Barriers to Science for Bowen Theory — And What We're Building
**Date:** Monday, February 9, 2026
**Format:** Zoom
**Duration:** 2 hours 45 minutes

## PART 1: THE PROBLEM (~35 min)

**Purpose:** Make the case that everyone—especially those of us in helping professions—must think as scientifically as we can. The stakes are too high not to.

### 1.1 Opening: The State of Behavioral Health

**The treatment-prevalence paradox (Ormel et al., 2022):**
- Treatment has increased **fourfold** since the 1990s
- Prevalence of mental disorders has **not decreased at all**
- More therapists, more medications, more awareness campaigns—no population-level improvement

**Relapse rates get worse, not better:**
- First depressive episode: ~50% relapse
- Second episode: ~70% relapse
- Third episode: ~90% relapse
- Treatment isn't preventing recurrence—we're managing something we don't understand

**Youth crisis:**
- 145% increase in teen depression (2010-2019)
- Teen girls: 57% report persistent sadness/hopelessness (CDC 2023)
- This happened *during* the greatest expansion of mental health treatment in history

**Replication crisis:**
- Only ~40% of psychology studies replicate
- 2013: NIH stopped funding research based exclusively on the DSM
- The DSM has no underlying theoretical framework—just symptom checklists

**The question:** We're doing more than ever. Why isn't it working?

**The implicit model:** The entire field assumes the problem is inside the individual. This determines treatment, research design, funding—everything. We're studying the blade of grass and ignoring the wind.

### 1.2 Historical Catastrophes

These are not ancient history. These are caring professionals—people like us—who caused massive harm because they weren't thinking scientifically.

**Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study (1939-1945):**

*The intervention:* At-risk boys randomly assigned to treatment or control. Treatment group received:
- Regular visits from counselors (average 5 years of contact)
- Academic tutoring
- Summer camps
- Medical and psychiatric care
- Community programs (YMCA, Boy Scouts)
- Family counseling when needed

*The intention:* Prevent delinquency through caring relationships and opportunity.

*The 30-year follow-up (Joan McCord):* Treatment group had **worse outcomes on every measure**:
- More criminal convictions
- More alcoholism
- More mental illness
- More stress-related diseases
- Died younger on average

**The counselors loved these boys. The boys reported the program positively changed their lives. And it killed them faster.**

How would we know? Without measurement, we wouldn't. We'd keep doing it.

**Recovered Memory Therapy (1980s-1990s):**

*What it was:* Therapists believed childhood sexual abuse was the hidden cause of adult problems—depression, anxiety, eating disorders. They used hypnosis, guided imagery, and suggestion to help patients "recover" repressed memories of abuse.

*What happened:* Patients began "remembering" horrific abuse that never occurred. They accused parents, relatives, neighbors. Families were destroyed. Some accused went to prison.

*The scale:*
- An estimated **1 million patients** treated with these techniques
- Tens of thousands of families torn apart by false accusations
- FBI investigated satanic ritual abuse claims across the country—found **zero corroborating physical evidence** in any case

*The end:* When malpractice suits mounted and the techniques were scrutinized, the epidemic disappeared. The "memories" stopped appearing when therapists stopped inducing them.

**These were licensed professionals with good intentions following the accepted practices of their field.**

### 1.3 The Pattern

When anxiety is high—perceived uncertainty plus urgency—people seek ways to reduce uncertainty.

An ideology that is **untestable** (can't be disproven) and **simple** (explains everything) provides immediate relief. Believers calm down. They feel like they understand.

But untestable means no self-correction. The real problem stays hidden. In the worst cases, the "treatment" does more damage than the original problem.

**This is not about bad people. It's about what happens when caring professionals don't think scientifically.**

The lobotomists weren't monsters—Walter Freeman won a Nobel Prize. The recovered memory therapists weren't predators—they believed they were healing trauma. The Cambridge-Somerville counselors weren't negligent—they loved those boys.

They just didn't have a way to test whether they were helping or hurting.

### 1.4 The Fatal Flaw in Bowen Theory

Now bring it home: **Bowen Theory has the same structural problem.**

There is no evidence that a single explicit predictive model exists for Bowen Theory.

**What do these terms mean?**
- **Explicit** = Outside the human brain; in material form that anyone can inspect
- **Predictive** = Makes forecasts about what will happen, not just explains what already happened
- **Model** = A simulation that produces testable predictions

**The state of the art:** The model is in the coach's head. The brain is the material the calculation runs on. When we say "theory predicts X," the prediction is happening mentally—not in any form others can test.

### 1.5 Markers of Pseudoscience

From Karl Popper and Scott Lilienfeld—applied honestly to Bowen Theory:

| Marker | How It Shows Up |
|--------|-----------------|
| **No falsifiable predictions** | Can always explain with "another triangle" or "one more generation" |
| **No self-correction** | Claims stay inside the in-group; rarely subjected to outside critique |
| **Circular definitions** | "Differentiation" defined using "solid self" defined using "differentiation" |
| **Obscurantist language** | Jargon only the in-group understands |
| **No boundary conditions** | Triangles are everywhere—what do they NOT predict? |
| **Reference to seminal thinker** | Arguments cite Bowen rather than testable models |

**These markers don't mean the observations are wrong. They mean we haven't proven they're right.**

And if we can't prove it—if we can't test it—how do we know we're not the next Cambridge-Somerville?

### 1.6 The Lung Cancer Test

Some 16-year-old creates a model that predicts lung cancer from imaging with 80% accuracy instead of 40%. Everyone gets it instantly—no mythology required. The focus shifts to the technology and the problem.

**If Bowen Theory had explicit predictive models that work, we'd talk about the models, not the mythology.** We wouldn't reference the Nim project and Murray Bowen's biography. We'd point to the predictions.

### 1.7 What Formal Research Actually Requires

All rigorous, formal research requires **data**.

Not impressions. Not case narratives. Not "I've seen this pattern." **Data.**

And data has requirements:
- **Systematically collected** — Same method every time, not ad hoc
- **Cleanly recorded** — Defined fields, not free-form notes
- **Sufficient sample size** — N > 1, ideally much larger
- **Comparable across cases** — Same format so you can aggregate
- **Available for critique** — Others can inspect it, challenge it, reanalyze it

Without data that meets these criteria, you don't have research. You have stories.

**The question for Bowen Theory:** What would we even collect? What's the data model?

---

## PART 2: SARF — THE MINIMAL DATA MODEL (~25 min)

**Purpose:** SARF is the answer. A minimal, systematic way to collect data on emotional process.

### 2.1 What's Needed

Before you can have a predictive model, you need a **data model**—a formal definition of what gets tracked.

A data model answers:
- What exactly do you record to capture what theory describes?
- What applies across every case—not just this family, but any family?
- How do you track triangles in a way that's not just mental, but recorded?

### 2.2 The SARF Pipeline

**R → A → S**

- **(R)elationship** shifts modulate **(A)nxiety**
- **(A)nxiety** modulates **(S)ymptoms**
- **(F)unctioning** is the independent clinical variable

**Value space for R:** conflict, distance, reciprocal functioning, child-focus, cutoff, inside (triangle), outside (triangle), define-self

**Value space for S, A, F:** up, down, same

### 2.3 The Atomic Operation

The smallest indivisible action: A **toward** or **away** move.

- One mover, one or more recipients
- Toward = increased contact
- Away = decreased contact
- Track arousal (operational definition of anxiety)

**What is a triangle?** One move that is simultaneously toward one and away from another.

### 2.4 Vertical Alignment

**One coding form gives you everything:**

| You code... | You get... |
|-------------|------------|
| Structured SARF entries | Direct comparison to AI extraction |
| Stream of changes | Real-time coding while interviewing |
| Defined fields | Stats without transformation |
| Same format | Replicable studies |

Design the data model right, and everything else falls into place.

### 2.5 Early Findings from the R&D

Even at this early stage, systematic data collection has revealed things we couldn't see before:

**Mutual discovery:** You can't survey for this data like a knee problem. The therapist must be in a process of *mutual discovery* with the client—exploring together, not extracting answers. The relationship affects what emerges. If you just interrogate, you don't get the data you need.

**Synthetic data trains faster:** The working group learned SARF coding faster on synthetic (AI-generated) clinical discussions than on real case recordings. Cleaner examples, known ground truth, faster iteration. Real recordings remain the goal—synthetic data accelerates getting there.

**The responsibility pattern:** Two 45-minute interviews with one person. They see for the first time—laid out on a timeline—a pattern of constantly picking up responsibility. Saying yes to everything, no filter. Anxiety going up and up. **No downs.** Just seeing the data organized was the breakthrough. No sophisticated analysis required.

**Timeline data clusters:** When you capture timeseries data in a standard Bowen-theory-driven clinical interview, the data naturally clusters into **3-5 notable periods**. Why? The client's own internal/emotional "sampling bias" determines which periods they report—they tell you about the times that are emotionally salient to *them*. These clusters ARE the "emotional process" described in Bowen theory. They typically follow a nodal/triggering event and reveal acute/episodic fluctuations in SARF variables over the baseline. The baseline is the state in the relatively quiet periods between clusters. **The clustering itself is the signal—you don't have to know what to look for.**

### 2.6 What You Get for Free

Here's the thing: **if you just focus on clean, correct, data-driven scientific practice, you get something you can actually call "Bowen theory."**

Bowen is in every family therapy textbook. But it's almost always misrepresented. The textbooks don't understand that Bowen was focused on natural science and predictive theory—not therapy. Most of the field still doesn't know the difference between theory and therapy. They think therapy *is* theory.

And right now, it takes practically unlimited reading and a three-year training program to understand how Bowen theory is actually different from everything else. You have to absorb so much to see the distinction.

But look at SARF. At the conceptual level, it's **obviously** different:
- Different from individual therapy (the unit of analysis is the relationship system, not the individual)
- Different from any other psychological data model (tracking R → A → S across a timeline of family functioning)

You don't need three years of training to see that this is something else. The data model makes the distinctiveness self-evident.

**Focus on the science, and you end up with Bowen theory—recognizably, demonstrably.**

## MID-PRESENTATION DISCUSSION (~20 min)

**Purpose:** Let questions and reactions surface before going into tools and technology.

### Discussion Prompts

1. **The historical catastrophes:** What's your reaction? Could you see yourself caught up in something like that?

2. **The pseudoscience markers:** Which ones hit closest to home?

3. **The SARF model:** Does this capture what you observe clinically? What's missing?

4. **The atomic operation:** Does toward/away match how you think about moves in a triangle?

---

## PART 3: WHAT WE'RE BUILDING (~30 min)

**Purpose:** Show the tools and demonstrate the level of rigor.

### 3.1 The Tool Ecosystem

| Tool | Status | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Family Diagram Pro** | Released | Timeline + diagram for clinicians |
| **Family Diagram Personal** | In development | AI intake, generates timeline/diagram via conversation |
| **IRR System** | In use | Research infrastructure, blind coding workflow |

### 3.2 APP DEMO — Family Diagram Pro

**[LIVE DEMO]**

Show:
- Timeline construction
- Functional facts
- Emotional process symbols with timestamps and notes
- Dynamic visualization
- How it simplifies presenting a case

**Key point:** This is the technology that makes it possible to present a clean argument in under 3 minutes. The data entry is designed so that cleaning it up and presenting it to a good-faith critic becomes feasible.

### 3.3 The R&D Project: btcopilot (Brief Overview)

This is not a toy. This is an open-source R&D project taking AI-assisted Bowen theory application to a serious level.

**The core idea:**
- LLMs can read and understand the Bowen literature (which is remarkably internally consistent)
- Chain multiple AI calls together as "building blocks"—each analyzing a different piece of the problem
- Combine the results into a coherent evaluation

**Building blocks example:**
- One call: Where are the key triangles?
- Another: What's the baseline anxiety vs. fluctuations?
- Another: What's the hypothetical baseline configuration?
- Final call: Synthesize into an overall formulation

**[SCREENSHOTS]**

Show:
- Mobile app interface with timeline data
- The clustering visualization (3-5 notable periods visible)
- Example of AI-generated case formulation

*Let the screenshots speak for themselves.*

### 3.5 The IRR + AI Pipeline

**Ground truth = what domain experts agreed on.**

| What AI Requires | What IRR Provides |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Labeled examples | Human-coded cases |
| Consistent labels | Agreement-verified coding |
| Scale | Growing database |

**Two Eras:**
- **Era 1:** AI learns from humans (we're building this)
- **Era 2:** AI discovers patterns humans couldn't see

---

## PART 4: IMPLICATIONS (~15 min)

**Purpose:** Show what becomes possible.

### 4.1 If This Works

**Certification**
- Objective competency testing
- Compare trainee coding to ground truth

**Standardized Training**
- Measurable outcomes
- Curriculum based on validated method

**Aggregate Research**
- Data across practitioners
- Statistical patterns emerge

### 4.2 Honest Assessment

**Where we are:**
- IRR working group active
- Synthetic data working
- Real recordings in exploration

This is what real R&D looks like. Early stage. Showing the process.

## PART 5: THE CHALLENGE (~15 min)

**Purpose:** Make it concrete. The climax.

### 5.1 The 3-Minute Challenge

I challenge anyone who believes Bowen Theory to be factual—even if not verified—to:

1. **Make a case presentation under 3 minutes** (ideally 2 minutes)
2. **Include only the minimum necessary data** for a clean argument
3. **Present to a good-faith critic** (someone who doesn't share the bias—like a physicist)
4. **Use a generalized formula, not ad hoc** (applies word-for-word to another family)
5. **Repeat with 3 more cases** (prove it replicates)

If that can be done, I would love to see it.

### 5.2 Why This Matters

This is the difference between:
- A belief system that only makes sense to the in-group
- A scientific claim that anyone can test

If we can't make a clean 3-minute case to someone outside the network, we haven't proven anything.

### 5.3 The App Seminar

**The Family Diagram App Seminar** is where this work happens.

What it is:
- Monthly Zoom sessions
- Exploring cases and methodology
- Building the skills to make clean arguments
- Contributing to the research effort

**Who it's for:**
- Clinicians who want to apply rigorous thinking to their cases
- People who want to contribute to the formal research effort
- PGP trainees are often the most interested and appropriate for this narrow scope

The PGP gives you the conceptual model. The app seminar is where you operationalize it.

## PART 6: CLOSING DISCUSSION (~25 min)

**Purpose:** Let the group go deeper.

### Discussion Threads

1. **The implicit model in your own practice:** Where do your predictions come from? Could you write them down?

2. **The 3-minute challenge:** Who wants to try it? What would you need?

3. **The differentiation question:** Is the modeling effort compatible with differentiation of self?

4. **Getting involved:** What's the next step for someone who wants to contribute?
