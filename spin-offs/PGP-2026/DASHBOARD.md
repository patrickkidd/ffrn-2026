## What This Folder Contains

This folder contains the development history of a 2h 45min lecture for the Bowen Center's Post-Graduate Program.

**For attendees:** The latest snapshot linked above is your companion document for Monday's lecture. It contains the full outline, key lines, and discussion prompts. The link may change; bookmark this page, not that page.

**For future reference:** All materials are plain-text markdown, version-controlled, and open source. The numbered snapshot files (`1-Initial-Outline.md` through `6-Rebalanced-Timing.md`) show how the presentation evolved through iterative refinement with AI assistance (Claude Code). The content produced here serves as *context* / inputs for future AI-driven content development.

## Thesis

"The conceptual model from Bowen theory is in your head—the brain is literally the material the calculation is performed on. The model is remarkably consistent in the literature, but it's not formalized. We're building the tools to change that. But first: can you make a 3-minute case to a good-faith critic? If not, we haven't proven anything."

## Development Notes

### Outline Snapshots

Each snapshot preserves a stage in the presentation's development:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `1-Initial-Outline.md` | First draft before clarifications |
| `2-Revised-Outline.md` | Restructured with mid-discussion, app demo priority |
| `3-Full-Content-Draft.md` | Added: data requirements, early findings (clustering), btcopilot as screenshots |
| `4-IRR-Vignette.md` | Added: nail-biting vignette as SARF coding example, expanded IRR Working Group section |
| `5-Haidt-Counterargument.md` | Added brief Haidt acknowledgment; emphasized "more resources, problems got worse" |
| `6-Rebalanced-Timing.md` | **Current** — Part 1 compressed to 25 min (hierarchical bullets), Part 2 extended to 35 min |

### Key Decisions

- **Pseudoscience thesis**: Don't soften it. Went over well at the Symposium.
- **App demo**: Main priority. Live demo of Family Diagram Pro.
- **btcopilot R&D**: Brief overview with screenshots (not live demo). Let the visuals land.
- **Climax**: The 3-minute challenge. "Prove it."
- **App Seminar pitch**: "The PGP gives you the conceptual model. The app seminar is where you operationalize it."
- **Haidt counterargument**: Brief parenthetical only—structural changes don't detract from main point.

### Todo

**Content (Done)**
- [x] Full content draft with all sections
- [x] Nail-biting vignette as SARF coding example
- [x] IRR working group section expanded
- [x] Haidt counterargument (brief)
- [x] Rebalanced timing (Part 1: 25 min, Part 2: 35 min)

**Before Presentation**
- [ ] Prepare demo case for Family Diagram Pro (timeline with functional facts)
- [ ] Prepare btcopilot screenshots (mobile app, clustering, AI formulation)
- [ ] Test Zoom screen share
- [ ] Dry run for timing (2h 45min target)
- [ ] Decide: slides or outline-only?

### Demo/Screenshot Checklist

- [ ] Family Diagram Pro open and ready for live demo
- [ ] Sample case loaded with timeline
- [ ] Zoom screen share tested
- [ ] btcopilot R&D screenshots prepared:
  - [ ] Mobile app interface with timeline
  - [ ] Clustering visualization (3-5 periods visible)
  - [ ] Example AI-generated case formulation
