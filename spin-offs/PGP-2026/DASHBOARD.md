**Date:** Monday, February 9, 2026 (Zoom)
**Duration:** 2 hours 45 minutes
**Audience:** Post-Graduate Program trainees at the Bowen Center for the Study of the Family

## Thesis

"The conceptual model is in your head—the brain is literally the material the calculation is performed on. The model is remarkably consistent in the literature, but it's not formalized. We're building the tools to change that. But first: can you make a 3-minute case to a good-faith critic? If not, we haven't proven anything."

## Arc

1. **The Problem** — Behavioral health field + Bowen Theory's fatal flaw (barriers to science)
2. **SARF** — The minimal data model
3. **Mid-discussion** — Let reactions surface
4. **What We're Building** — App demo (priority) + BT Co-pilot (brief)
5. **The Challenge** — "Prove it" with 3-minute case
6. **App Seminar Pitch** — PGP → App Seminar pathway

## Presentation Structure

| Part | Topic | Duration |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | The Problem (behavioral health + barriers to science) | 35 min |
| 2 | SARF as Minimal Data Model | 25 min |
| — | **Mid-Presentation Discussion** | 20 min |
| 3 | What We're Building (app demo + BT Co-pilot) | 30 min |
| 4 | Implications | 15 min |
| 5 | The Challenge + App Seminar | 15 min |
| 6 | Closing Discussion | 25 min |

**Total: 2h 45min**

## Key Decisions

- **Pseudoscience thesis**: Don't soften it. Went over well at the Symposium. PGP leadership needs this expertise.
- **App demo**: Main priority. Live demo of Family Diagram Pro—shows the technology that makes clean 3-minute cases feasible.
- **btcopilot R&D**: Brief overview with screenshots (not live demo). Include mobile app screenshots showing clustering. Let the visuals land.
- **Climax**: The 3-minute challenge. "Prove it."
- **App Seminar pitch**: PGP trainees are ideal candidates. "The PGP gives you the conceptual model. The app seminar is where you operationalize it."
- **Haidt counterargument**: Brief parenthetical acknowledgment only—structural changes like social media don't detract from main point.

## Demo/Screenshot Checklist

- [ ] Family Diagram Pro open and ready for live demo
- [ ] Sample case loaded with timeline
- [ ] Zoom screen share tested
- [ ] btcopilot R&D screenshots prepared:
  - [ ] Mobile app interface with timeline
  - [ ] Clustering visualization (3-5 periods visible)
  - [ ] Example AI-generated case formulation

## Outline Snapshots

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `1-Initial-Outline.md` | First draft before clarifications |
| `2-Revised-Outline.md` | Restructured with mid-discussion, app demo priority |
| `3-Full-Content-Draft.md` | Added: data requirements, early findings (clustering), "what you get for free", btcopilot as screenshots |
| `4-IRR-Vignette.md` | Added: nail-biting vignette as SARF coding example, expanded IRR Working Group section showing what humans are doing |
| `5-Haidt-Counterargument.md` | **Current** — Added brief Haidt acknowledgment (social media/structural changes); emphasized "more resources, problems got worse" |

## Todo

### Content (Done)
- [x] Full content draft with all sections
- [x] Nail-biting vignette as SARF coding example
- [x] IRR working group section expanded
- [x] Haidt counterargument (brief)

### Before Presentation
- [ ] Prepare demo case for Family Diagram Pro (timeline with functional facts)
- [ ] Prepare btcopilot screenshots (mobile app, clustering, AI formulation)
- [ ] Test Zoom screen share
- [ ] Dry run for timing (2h 45min target)
- [ ] Decide: slides or outline-only?
