# PGP 2026 Lecture: Draft Outline

**Working Title:** The Modeling Phase: What's Been Missing from Bowen Theory
**Duration:** 2 hours 45 minutes

---

## PART 1: SYNTHESIS OF THE PRE-READING (~20 min)

**Purpose:** Establish common ground, show how the pieces fit together.

### 1.1 Opening

"You've done the reading. Let me tell you what you now know—and what it means."

The five pieces you read form a coherent argument:
1. **Research Methodology** — Two-phase process: Collecting → Massaging
2. **Timeline video** — The timeline is the backbone; facts vs functional facts
3. **Barriers to Science** — The absence of explicit predictive models; markers of pseudoscience
4. **AI Revolution** — LLMs can operationalize the conceptual model; building blocks for automation
5. **SARF White Paper** — Minimal data model: R → A → S, with F as independent variable

### 1.2 The Core Insight

Together, these make one argument: **Bowen theory describes what the family emotional system does, but not how to prove it.**

The theory is rich. The observations are real. The conceptual model is remarkably internally consistent in the literature. But:
- The model is in the coach's head, not in material form
- Predictions are implicit, not explicit
- There are no predictive models that anyone outside the network can test

### 1.3 Discussion Prompt

"Before we go further: what questions did the reading raise for you?"

## PART 2: BARRIERS TO SCIENCE (~40 min)

**Purpose:** Define what's been missing and why it matters.

### 2.1 The Fatal Flaw

There is no evidence that there is a single explicit predictive model for Bowen Theory itself.

**Explicit** = Outside the human brain; the calculation occurs in material form
**Predictive** = Makes forecasts about what will happen
**Model** = A simulation of the phenomenon

**The state of the art in Bowen theory:** The model that's being executed—the rules, the algorithm—is in the coach's head. The brain is literally the material that the calculation gets performed on.

### 2.2 Markers of Pseudoscience (Applied to Bowen Theory)

From Karl Popper and Scott Lilienfeld:

| Marker | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| No falsifiable predictions | Can always explain away with "another triangle" |
| No self-correction | Propositions stay inside the in-group |
| Circular definitions | Concepts depend on other concepts that depend back |
| Obscurantist language | Jargon that only the in-group understands |
| No boundary conditions | Triangles are everywhere; can't limit scope of prediction |
| Anecdotal evidence | Case studies without generalizable formula |
| Reference to seminal thinker | Focus on Bowen rather than the models |

### 2.3 Why Explicit Models Matter

Well-replicated predictive models are instantly accepted. This is deeper than a human idea—it's tied to natural laws.

**The lung cancer example:** Some 16-year-old creates a model that predicts lung cancer from imaging with 80% accuracy instead of 40%. Everyone gets it instantly. The mythology of the person disappears—the focus shifts to the actual technology and the problem domain.

**If Bowen Theory had explicit predictive models that work, the market of ideas would take the models, not the mythology.** We wouldn't talk about the Nim project and Murray Bowen's biography—we'd talk about the models.

### 2.4 The Two Kinds of "Research"

**Must differentiate:**
- Research on one's own family (applying research principles to become more objective)
- Formal scientific research (explicit predictive models with multiple samples, good-faith critique)

These are not the same. The first is valuable for differentiation. The second requires:
- Multiple sample sizes
- Researchers not so close to the data
- Good-faith critique from outside the network

**If research is biased towards one's own family and away from formal research, there will be less progress in formal research.**

### 2.5 The Data Model and Atomic Operation

Before you can have a predictive model, you need a **data model**—a definition of what is tracked.

**The atomic operation of Bowen theory:** A **toward** or **away** move.
- One mover, one or more recipients
- Toward = increased contact
- Away = decreased contact
- Track arousal (operational definition of anxiety)

**What is a triangle?** One move that is simultaneously toward one and away from another.

This is finding terms that get close enough to track data and test—different from thinking at the conceptual level.

### 2.6 Discussion Prompt

"Which markers of pseudoscience hit closest to home? What would it take to address them?"

## PART 3: SARF AS MINIMAL DATA MODEL (~30 min)

**Purpose:** Show how SARF provides the data model that's been missing.

### 3.1 The SARF Pipeline

**R → A → S**

- **(R)elationship** shifts modulate **(A)nxiety**
- **(A)nxiety** modulates **(S)ymptoms**
- **(F)unctioning** is the independent clinical variable—higher F lessens the impact of R on A on S

**Value space for R:** conflict, distance, reciprocal functioning, child-focus, cutoff, inside (triangle), outside (triangle), define-self

**Value space for S, A, F:** up, down, same

### 3.2 Timeline Integration

The timeline of shifts in each variable is collected in clinical assessment:
- "Timeline of nodal events"
- Training required to gather context variables (A and R)
- Once collected, evaluate for correlations with S

This is the methodology from the article: Collecting (Gathering + Parsing) → Massaging (Pruning + Tagging)

### 3.3 Vertical Alignment

**One coding form gives you everything:**

| You code... | You get... |
|-------------|------------|
| Structured SARF entries | Direct comparison to AI extraction |
| Stream of changes | Real-time coding while interviewing |
| Defined fields | Stats without transformation |
| Same format | Replicable studies |
| Curated cases | Growing ground truth database |

Design the data model right, and everything else falls into place.

### 3.4 What SARF Is Not

SARF is not a comprehensive model. It's intentionally minimal—100% data-driven, increases in precision as evidence permits.

The principle is like NIH's RDoC: minimum categories required to test hypotheses formally. As more is learned, more nuance is added.

### 3.5 Discussion Prompt

"Where does SARF oversimplify? What's the first variable that should be added?"

## PART 4: THE AI REVOLUTION (~30 min)

**Purpose:** Show how AI can operationalize the conceptual model.

### 4.1 How LLMs Work (The Basic Loop)

1. **Query** — Full sentences, or even rows of table data as plain text
2. **Search** — Goes out into its knowledge domain
3. **Pull** — Retrieves relevant information
4. **Write** — Returns a response in English

That's it—that's the full loop.

### 4.2 The BT Co-Pilot Approach

Instead of using the general internet knowledge base (ChatGPT), we use a **Bowen database**—all of the Bowen literature.

Why this matters: **The conceptual model is remarkably internally consistent in the literature.**

You can derive a lot of the conceptual model from the literature alone. The literature is a good model for the state-of-the-art of Bowen Theory—not very precise, but at least there's a possibility of extracting the model from it.

The LLM can read the literature and understand it all—it basically has the conceptual model in there.

### 4.3 The Building Blocks Concept

The real innovation is **chaining**:

1. Run the process on one small piece of the problem
2. Run separate ones on other pieces
3. Combine the results in a new prompt

**Example building blocks:**
- Where are the key triangles?
- Where are the nodal events?
- What's the baseline anxiety vs. the fluctuations?
- What's the hypothetical baseline configuration?

Each becomes an LLM call. Then a final prompt combines them:
"How do you summarize all of these responses and make a suggestion?"

### 4.4 The Vision: An "Evaluate" Button

What you're doing is **modeling Bowen Theory**—breaking the evaluation into small pieces and bringing them back together.

This is the first chance to actually put the rubber on the road. It doesn't have to change anything in Bowen Theory—it's actually **defining it more clearly**.

What are the pieces of an evaluation? What is Bowen Theory, operationally?

The vision: One button—"Evaluate"—that runs a script and spits out a report based on the data in the family diagram.

### 4.5 The IRR Connection

**Ground truth = what domain experts agreed on.**

| What AI Requires | What IRR Provides |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Labeled examples | Human-coded cases |
| Consistent labels | Agreement-verified coding |
| Scale | Growing database |

**Two Eras:**
- **Era 1:** AI learns from humans (IRR establishes ground truth, AI replicates)
- **Era 2:** AI discovers new patterns (finds correlations humans couldn't see)

We're building Era 1. Era 2 follows.

### 4.6 Discussion Prompt

"What would you want an 'Evaluate' button to tell you? What pieces of the evaluation matter most?"

## PART 5: IMPLICATIONS AND TOOLS (~25 min)

**Purpose:** Show what becomes possible and how to get involved.

### 5.1 If This Works

**Certification**
- Objective competency testing
- Compare trainee coding to ground truth
- This is more concrete than anything this professional network has produced in decades

**Standardized Training**
- Measurable outcomes
- Curriculum based on validated method

**Aggregate Research**
- Data across practitioners
- Statistical patterns emerge

### 5.2 The Tool Ecosystem

| Tool | Status | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Pro App** | Released | Timeline + diagram for clinicians |
| **Personal App** | In development | Structured AI intake, generates timeline/diagram via conversation |
| **IRR System** | In use | Research infrastructure, blind coding workflow |

Pro and Personal are vertically integrated: Personal generates the case file, Pro opens it.

### 5.3 What PGP Trainees Can Contribute

- **Learn SARF coding** — Become part of the ground truth
- **Contribute cases** — Growing the database
- **Test the apps** — Feedback on clinical utility
- **Be the domain experts** — You set the standard, not the machines

### 5.4 Honest Assessment

**Where we are:**
- First IRR meeting: [date]
- Synthetic data: working
- Real recordings: exploring

This is what real R&D looks like. Early stage. Showing the process.

## PART 6: THE CHALLENGE (~15 min)

**Purpose:** Make it concrete and actionable.

### 6.1 The 3-Minute Challenge

I challenge anyone who believes Bowen Theory to be factual—even if not verified—to:

1. **Make a case presentation under 3 minutes** (ideally 2 minutes)
2. **Include only the minimum necessary data** for a clean argument
3. **Present to a good-faith critic** (someone who doesn't share the bias—like a physicist)
4. **Use a generalized formula, not ad hoc** (applies word-for-word to another family)
5. **Repeat with 3 more cases** (prove it replicates)

If that can be done, I would love to see it.

### 6.2 Why This Matters

This is not an academic exercise. This is the difference between:
- A belief system that only makes sense to the in-group
- A scientific claim that anyone can test

If we can't make a clean 3-minute case to someone outside the network, we haven't proven anything.

### 6.3 What the Tools Enable

The Family Diagram app is designed to simplify data entry and produce dynamic visualizations—so that someone who doesn't already believe can understand the argument without going through all the data themselves.

The goal: Make that data clean, present it to someone who doesn't share the bias, do it multiple times.

## PART 7: OPEN DISCUSSION (~30 min)

**Purpose:** Let the group go deeper on what matters to them.

### Potential Discussion Threads

1. **The implicit model in your own practice:** Where do your predictions come from? Could you write them down?

2. **The differentiation question:** Is the modeling effort compatible with differentiation of self? Or is it a different enterprise?

3. **The "ninth concept":** When is a model that's factually inaccurate but more adaptive still useful? How does this relate to clinical work?

4. **Triangles in practice:** Does the toward/away atomic operation match what you see? What's missing?

5. **AI concerns:** What are the real risks? What would responsible deployment look like?

6. **The 3-minute challenge:** Who wants to try it? What would you need?

### Audience Calibration

This audience is more sophisticated than FFRN:
- Already trained in Bowen theory
- Already accept the premises
- Can handle more technical depth
- May have stronger critiques

**Potential pushback points:**
- "Isn't this reducing the richness of clinical observation?"
- "How does this relate to differentiation of self?"
- "Isn't the implicit model the whole point?"
- "Can AI really capture this?"
- "The pseudoscience markers are too harsh."

**Potential receptivity points:**
- They've felt the frustration of trying to communicate Bowen theory outside the network
- They've done research on their own families and know the limitations
- They're interested in how to make the theory more rigorous
