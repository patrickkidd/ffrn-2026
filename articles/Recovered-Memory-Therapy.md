## Overview

Recovered memory therapy (RMT) was a form of psychotherapy that aimed to recover supposedly repressed memories of childhood abuse through techniques including hypnosis, guided imagery, and suggestion. The practice led to an estimated 1 million patients being convinced they had memories of abuse that never occurred, destroying tens of thousands of families and resulting in wrongful imprisonments.

## The Core Belief

### The Claim
- Traumatic memories, especially of childhood sexual abuse, could be completely **repressed** into the unconscious
- These memories could be **reliably recovered** through therapeutic techniques
- Symptoms like depression, eating disorders, or anxiety were evidence of hidden abuse

### The Techniques
- **Hypnosis**
- **Sodium amytal** ("truth serum")
- **Guided imagery** and visualization
- **Dream interpretation**
- **Age regression**
- **Journaling** with prompts suggesting abuse
- **"Body memories"**—interpreting physical sensations as evidence of abuse

---

## Scale of the Problem

### Patient Impact
- **Estimated 1 million patients** convinced they had repressed memories (UC Berkeley estimate)
- Patients who underwent RMT showed **decline in psychological health, functioning, and well-being**
- Many came to believe they had been ritually abused by satanic cults

### Family Destruction
- **"Tens of thousands of families"** destroyed by false accusations
- Parents, grandparents, siblings falsely accused of incest, satanic abuse
- Family relationships severed, often permanently
- Children removed from families based on "recovered" accusations

### Criminal Justice Impact
- People **imprisoned** with recovered memories as sole evidence
- Careers destroyed
- Some served decades before exoneration

## Elizabeth Loftus and the Science of False Memory

### Who She Is
- American psychologist, UC Irvine
- Pioneer in memory research
- Demonstrated repeatedly how unreliable and malleable memory is

### Key Research Findings
- **Memories can be implanted:** Full-grown adults can have entire fake memories created
- **The misinformation effect:** Post-event information alters memory of original event
- **"Lost in the mall" study:** Researchers successfully implanted false memories of being lost in a shopping mall as a child
- **No credible scientific support** for the claim that extreme trauma is completely repressed and later reliably recovered

---

## Professional Response

### Official Warnings
- **1993:** American Psychiatric Association issued alert about distinguishing memories
- **1994:** American Medical Association classified recovering memories as "fraught with problems of potential misapplication"
- **Today:** American Psychological Association advises caution, recommends avoiding preconceptions about abuse, suggests seeking corroborating evidence

### Legal Consequences
- Malpractice suits against therapists
- License revocations
- Fraud charges
- **Largest settlement:** $10.6 million against psychiatrist and hospital for convincing woman and her two young children they were victims of satanic ritual abuse and had multiple personalities. Children hospitalized for years.
- **Since 1999:** Majority of recovered memory suits dropped or dismissed

---

## The FBI Investigation

- FBI investigated claims of satanic ritual abuse emerging in therapy sessions
- Found **zero evidence** of the widespread satanic cult activity described
- No bodies, no crime scenes, no physical evidence of any kind
- Abuse allegations validated only by the therapy sessions themselves

---

## Retractors

Many patients later concluded their memories were false:
- Cut off ties to family based on false accusations
- Some had sought to destroy their families
- Many sued former therapists for planting false memories
- **False Memory Syndrome Foundation** created by families torn apart by accusations

## Why It Spread

1. **Fit prevailing beliefs:** Trauma was seen as hidden cause of adult problems
2. **Therapist confidence:** Practitioners believed they were uncovering truth
3. **Patient suggestibility:** Hypnosis and guided techniques highly suggestive
4. **Cultural moment:** Satanic panic created receptive environment
5. **Emotional investment:** Both therapist and patient invested in "discovery"
6. **Questioning = denial:** Skeptics accused of protecting abusers
