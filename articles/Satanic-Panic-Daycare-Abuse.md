## Overview

The Satanic Panic was a moral panic in the United States during the 1980s and early 1990s centered on claims that satanic cults were ritually abusing children, particularly in daycare centers. Despite **12,000+ documented accusations nationwide**, investigating police found no evidence to substantiate the claims. The panic resulted in numerous wrongful convictions, destroyed careers, and traumatized children through aggressive interviewing.

  - Trauma
  - Children being children
  - Overzealous interviewers
  - Urban legends

### Impact

3. **Suggestive interviewing:** Children told what to say
4. **Confirmation bias:** Any denial seen as evidence of trauma
5. **Media amplification:** Sensational coverage
6. **Questioning = supporting abuse:** Skeptics attacked as "protecting abusers"
