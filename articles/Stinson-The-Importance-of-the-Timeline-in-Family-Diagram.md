## Introduction

This is Patrick Stinson with a little video on some basics for constructing a timeline. The reason I'm putting this video together is because the timeline and the diagram are together the backbone of understanding a family using the Family Diagram app.

The diagram has been a part of applying Bowen theory to human problems since the beginning and it's an integral part. Whenever a coach sees a client, one of the very first things that happens is that a family diagram is constructed. It has the basics about reproductive structure in the family—essentially who is who, how they're related—and maybe some basic details about the emotional process in the family, how the family manages stress and anxiety.

## What the App Brings to the Table

What the app brings to the table is a timeline. It does this in a number of ways, but nominally, when you add births and deaths to people in the diagram, it automatically compiles them in an overall family timeline. You can then fill out the timeline with other important events, notable events in the family's history, in order to understand what is predictable in the way that this family manages tension and anxiety—which is what Bowen theory describes.

Engaging with the app for the first time really requires a person to construct a timeline. Merely constructing a timeline forces one to get a lot clearer about what is known and what is not known about a family. Before, you could just draw a 2D diagram and maybe put some dates on there where a timeline was implied, but here the timeline is formalized.

## What Goes Into a Timeline: Facts

A timeline should only contain facts. In fact, the entire diagram—timeline or not—should only contain facts. But when you're talking about humans, getting clear on what is and is not a fact becomes a pretty important thing in constructing a timeline. It's so easy to get caught up in opinion or subjective impression and proceed with it as if it is a fact.

For example, a person might say:
- "My mother never liked me"
- "I never got along with my sibling"
- "We never talked to my dad's family because they are so-and-so"

These kinds of things tend to be more subjective impression than objective fact. A systems assessment or investigation uncovers a multitude of details that transforms those impressions into fact to get a more accurate view of what's going on.

A timeline most simply contains regular facts—that births and deaths occurred on this or that date. That is a fact in time that can be converged upon in conversation. Maybe a date isn't known; that's fine. A lot of dates are frequently unknown and you do the best you can. The first thing you're entering is ballpark when a person was born. I use the convention: if I only know the year, I just set the month and the date as 1-1 (for example, 1-1-1982 means somewhere in 1982 this event happened). The task is just to start entering information into the timeline.

## Functional Facts

Murray Bowen introduced this idea of a **functional fact**, which helps slice the subjectivity out of historical information to keep the information based on facts.

An example of a functional fact is something like:
- A feeling orientation flipping
- A shift in a subjective impression
- The fact that a subjective impression occurred

These things occur in relation to the predictable processes that are going on in the family according to Bowen theory.

The prototypical example of a functional fact is that *a person had a dream* is a fact. What the dream meant and all that kind of stuff may or may not be factual—in fact, it's rarely factual. But that the person had a dream can be a fact. That it happened on a particular day can be a fact. That it happened before a birth and not after a birth can be a fact. A systems assessment is correlating important events through time, so these things become incredibly useful.

### Example: A Case Study

One example of a functional fact that occurred in a case for me was when there was a diagnosis and a shift in functioning for a particular family member—a grandmother to a client. There was a diagnosis with medical symptoms, and at the same time, that person's political orientation shifted in a polarized manner. They went from being on one side of the proverbial political aisle to another—a hard position in one direction to a hard position in the other. Their view on religion also shifted in that kind of binary polarized way—hard one way to hard the other way.

It is a fact that the shift occurred—that a shift in that opinion occurred. Looking into whether this or that perspective on life or political orientation is more valid than another is not a fact. But it is a fact that the shift occurred.

## What to Include in the Timeline

The timeline consists of facts in this manner:
- Births
- Deaths
- Hirings
- Firings
- Cutoffs
- Resolution of cutoffs
- Shifts in focus from one person to another (from the parents, prototypically)—this could be a fact if it was marked enough
- Divorces

Marking these on the timeline and getting them at least in order—if not with precise dates—is one important step, if not maybe the first important step, in putting a case into the app.

## Constructing the Diagram vs. Timeline

It goes without saying—or it's more straightforward, more self-evident—how to construct the diagram, because we all understand that everybody has parents, and then you just need to know how to set up those relationships on the diagram (covered in the tutorial videos for the Family Diagram app).

What is not as clear is what goes on the timeline. I've worked with a number of people who are even very experienced with Bowen theory who are starting to get used to thinking in this new way of putting together what is known about the chronological timeline of the family being worked on.

## Individual Consultation Sessions

I offer individual consultation sessions for using the app after the typical technical support options are exhausted—starting with email support, just answering questions (that's the most typical). When somebody has something more substantial they're working on, and usually if they've got some training in Bowen theory, then I'll have an individual consultation session with them.

What I am discovering is that it makes a huge difference if that person has gone through the effort to compile a timeline of the family prior to that consultation session—regardless of their level of experience with Bowen theory.

## The Goal of This Video

My goal here with this video is to point out:
1. What goes into a timeline (which I've hopefully described)
2. That putting together a timeline—at least on paper and then into the app (so long as that's technically possible for that person)—is the first step and an essential step, an unavoidable step in entering a case into the app

Once you accomplish that, the reason it is so important is not only that the app is organized around the timeline and the diagram (where neither one can be avoided), but that when you construct a timeline, when you start putting things in order, it is a major step towards **systems thinking**.

Systems thinking is thinking in terms of how processes play out over time. That automatically forces you to get more objective about what is and is not known about the family.

## Practical Approach

If you're putting together a table with:
- A date as the first basic column
- A description or title for the second basic column (the fact that occurred on that date)

Then it automatically has you organize what is known and what is not known about the family as a system—and a system is something that has predictable behavior through time.

Not all the dates are going to be known. You do the best you can. If you don't have dates for a particular event or even a whole slew of events, you:
1. Write out the dates for the events that you do have
2. Get the facts to be as short and concise as possible
3. When you don't have dates, at least try to get the order right
4. If you don't have even the order, take note of that—say "here are these other events that I know or suspect were very important in the family, but I don't have dates for them yet, and I'm not even really sure if they occurred before or after these other dates"

Systematically laying out what is known and not known—putting a timeline together is a huge step in that direction.

## Conclusion

This is a simple task, actually, but it's probably a new task to get this formal about it. I don't think it's doing anything different than has ever been attempted in Bowen theory before—it's just doing it more rigorously. It's accomplishing a basic task in the application of Bowen theory more completely.

But it doesn't mean having every single event to describe a particular family or a particular aspect of the emotional process in a family. You don't have to have all the dates. The task is just to put down what is known:
- The dates
- What occurred on those dates
- If you don't have the dates, at least try to get the order right
- If you're not even clear on the order, at least write down that events occurred but leave the dates out so you can clarify that down the road

Compiling a timeline is the essential first step for cataloging a case in the app. Putting the diagram together is part of it, but one cannot proceed in making use of the app without constructing a timeline—at least on paper before putting it into the app.

I'd like as always to hear any kind of feedback about what is clear and not clear in this video, and I hope that you can make use of the app as much as you can.
