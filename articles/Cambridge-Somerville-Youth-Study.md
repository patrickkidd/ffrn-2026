## Overview

The Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study was the **first large-scale randomized experiment in the history of criminology**. Designed to prevent juvenile delinquency through caring intervention, the 30-year follow-up revealed that the treatment group fared **worse** than controls on virtually every measure—including criminal offending, alcohol abuse, mental health, and **premature death**.

---

## Study Design (1936-1945)

### Commissioned By
Dr. Richard Cabot, Boston physician, in 1936

### Purpose
Evaluate whether early intervention could prevent or reduce juvenile delinquency

### Participants
- **506 boys**, ages 5-13 years old
- From underprivileged backgrounds in Cambridge and Somerville, Massachusetts
- **Matched carefully** into treatment and control groups
- Assignment by **coin toss** (true randomization)

### Treatment Group Received
- Assigned personal **counselor**
- **Academic tutoring**
- **Medical and psychiatric attention**
- Referrals to:
  - YMCA
  - Boy Scouts
  - **Summer camps**
  - Community programs

### Control Group
- Only told to report regularly
- No intervention

### Duration
- Active intervention: 1939-1945 (average 5 years per boy)
- Some boys received treatment for up to 8 years

## Joan McCord's 30-Year Follow-Up (1975-1979)

### Who She Was
- Criminologist who conducted systematic long-term follow-up
- Located records for **480 participants (95%)** in 1975-76
- Conducted interviews/questionnaires with 347
- By 1979: records for **494 participants (98%)**
- Mean age at follow-up: **45 years**

## The Shocking Results

### Overall Finding
The treatment group had **not fared better on any outcome**, and fared **worse** on multiple key measures.

### Specific Outcomes: Treatment Group Did WORSE

| Outcome | Treatment vs. Control |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Criminal offending** | More likely to commit 2+ crimes |
| **Alcohol abuse** | Higher rates |
| **Mental illness symptoms** | Higher rates |
| **Occupational prestige** | Lower |
| **Job satisfaction** | Lower |
| **High blood pressure** | Higher rates |
| **Heart trouble** | Higher rates |
| **Stress-related disorders** | Higher rates |
| **Premature mortality** | More deaths before age 35 |

### McCord's Conclusion
"The treatment program **may have been harmful**."

"By middle age, treatment group men had experienced **more undesirable outcomes** than their matched controls."

---

## Hypotheses for Harm

McCord proposed four explanations:

### 1. Middle-Class Values Imposition
Counselors imposed middle-class values on lower-class youth that did not fit their circumstances

### 2. Dependency and Loss
Boys became dependent on counselors; when program ended, they lost a source of help and support

### 3. Labeling Effect
Being identified as "at-risk" and receiving intervention may have labeled boys in harmful ways

### 4. Peer Deviancy Hypothesis (Most Important)
- Summer camp experiences brought at-risk youth together
- **Peer reinforcement of delinquent behaviors**
- Boys may have **bragged about delinquent behaviors**
- Negative peer influence amplified rather than reduced problems

## Key Quotes

### Joan McCord
"No one had ever discussed the possibility that intervention—where you're going to a family and you're offering help or you're sending children to summer camp... that there is any potential for harmful effects."

"Unless social programs are **evaluated for potential harm as well as benefit, safety as well as efficacy**, the choice of which social programs to use will remain a **dangerous guess**."

---

## Significance

### First Evidence of Iatrogenic Social Programs
- Demonstrated that well-intentioned programs can cause harm
- "They do not just fail, they produce **iatrogenic effects**"

### Changed Understanding of Intervention
- Intervention programs, however well-intentioned and well-designed, have the **capacity to produce damaging outcomes**
- **Caring is not enough**
- Good intentions without measurement can make things worse

### Methodological Legacy
- Model for rigorous randomized evaluation
- Data still being analyzed 80+ years later
- One of the longest-running criminological datasets

---

## Connection to Other Examples

### DARE Program
- Also spread to 80% of US schools
- Also showed no positive effect
- Continued for decades despite evidence

### Scared Straight
- Also well-intentioned (scare kids away from crime)
- Also showed participants did **worse** than controls
- Also continued despite evidence

### Common Thread
Well-intentioned helping, informed by intuition rather than measurement, spread through professions and institutions. In each case, the intervention **made things worse**.

## Pattern Elements (for presentation)

| Element | Cambridge-Somerville |
|---------|---------------------|
| No objective evidence | Intervention based on intuition about what helps |
| No way to test validity | No prior controlled trials of caring intervention |
| Emotion as glue | Care, hope, professional commitment |
| Spread through profession | Model for many subsequent programs |
| Ended in calamity | Treatment group: more crime, more illness, earlier death |
