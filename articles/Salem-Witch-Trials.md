## Overview

The Salem witch trials were a series of hearings and prosecutions of people accused of witchcraft in colonial Massachusetts between February 1692 and May 1693. It was the deadliest witch hunt in the history of colonial North America.

## Timeline

- **January 1692:** 9-year-old Elizabeth Parris and 11-year-old Abigail Williams begin having fits, violent contortions, and uncontrollable screaming
- **February 1692:** Local doctor blames the supernatural. Under pressure from magistrates, the girls blame three women: Tituba (enslaved), Sarah Good (homeless beggar), Sarah Osborne (elderly)
- **March-September 1692:** Accusations spread to 150+ people across 25 New England communities
- **June-September 1692:** 19 people hanged on four execution dates
- **September 1692:** Giles Corey pressed to death for refusing to enter plea
- **October 1692:** Governor Phips dissolves Court of Oyer and Terminer after prominent minister Increase Mather denounces spectral evidence
- **May 1693:** Phips pardons all remaining prisoners

## The Evidence Used

**Spectral Evidence:** Testimony about dreams and visions. "If somebody says in court, 'I saw John Proctor flying through the sky,' this would be entered as evidence that John Proctor is in league with the devil."

The Puritans believed physical realities had spiritual causes. Without specific colony laws, judges accepted this testimony as valid evidence.

**The Problem:** By October 1692, authorities began questioning whether the devil could make someone think they saw something that didn't happen—rendering spectral evidence meaningless.

Increase Mather: "It were better that ten suspected witches should escape than one innocent person be condemned."

## Death Toll and Accusations

- **200+ accused** across 25 communities
- **30 found guilty**
- **19 executed by hanging** (14 women, 5 men)
- **1 pressed to death** (Giles Corey, age 71—the only person in American history executed by pressing)
- **5+ died in prison** from disease
- **Youngest accused:** Dorothy Good, age 4, imprisoned for 8 months

---

## How It Ended

1. **Doubt about evidence:** Leading clergymen questioned spectral evidence
2. **Prominent citizens accused:** Including the governor's wife
3. **Court dissolved:** October 29, 1692
4. **New court established:** Superior Court of Judicature disallowed spectral evidence, convicted only 3 of 56 defendants
5. **All pardoned:** May 1693

## Aftermath and Admissions

- Within years, jurors signed public apologies
- The haphazard trial procedures contributed to changes in U.S. court procedures:
  - Rights to legal representation
  - Rights to cross-examination
  - Presumption of innocence
- **July 2022:** Elizabeth Johnson Jr., the last convicted Salem "witch," was officially exonerated—330 years later
