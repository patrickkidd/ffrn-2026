## Overview

Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly called Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), was rarely diagnosed before 1970 (~200 cases in all prior history). After recognition in DSM-III in 1980, diagnoses exploded to **50,000 by the 1990s**, then declined sharply. This trajectory follows the pattern of a medical fad, with strong evidence that many cases were **iatrogenic**—created by the therapy itself.

## The Statistical Evidence

### Before 1970
- Fewer than **100 diagnoses by 1944**
- Only **one further case** reported in the next two decades
- Total: approximately **200 cases** in all recorded history

### The Explosion (1980s-1990s)
- **DSM-III (1980):** MPD officially recognized as diagnosis
- Cases skyrocketed
- **40,000 cases** by end of 20th century
- Some estimates: **50,000 diagnoses** by mid-1990s
- More cases identified **in 5 years prior to 1986** than in preceding two centuries

### The Decline
- Interest declined after 1990s
- Research publications peaked mid-1990s, then rapidly fell
- Compared to 25 other diagnoses, the mid-1990s "bubble" was **unique to DID**

---

## Changes in Presentation

### Average Number of "Alters"
- **Before 1980s:** Most cases had only the primary personality and one alter
- **Mid-1980s:** Average rose to **13 alters** per case

This increase in both cases and complexity raised professional skepticism.

## Connection to Other Fads

### Satanic Panic
- MPD epidemic "closely tied to the satanic panic"
- Therapists used hypnosis to "discover" alters
- Believed they were recovering forgotten memories of satanic ritual abuse
- FBI failed to validate any allegations against caregivers

### Recovered Memory Therapy
- Same techniques: hypnosis, guided imagery, suggestion
- Same therapists often involved
- Same patient population targeted
- Decline of both occurred simultaneously

---

## The Sybil Effect

### The Book (1973)
- *Sybil* by Flora Schreiber became worldwide sensation
- Told story of patient with multiple personalities
- Therapist Cornelia Wilbur "unraveled" different personalities
- **First to relate MPD to childhood sexual abuse**
- Created prototype of what it "looked like" to be a "multiple"

### Later Revelations
- Story **found to be fraudulent**
- Sybil (Shirley Mason) later said she had made up the personalities
- Wilbur had used hypnosis and suggestion
- Despite this, the book shaped diagnosis for decades

## The Iatrogenic Model

### The Claim
DID is largely or entirely created by therapy itself, not discovered.

### Evidence
1. **Therapist clustering:** Some clinicians diagnose DID disproportionately more than others
2. **Timing:** Core symptoms tend to emerge **only after treatment begins**
3. **Technique dependence:** Cases emerged from specific practices (hypnosis, suggestion)
4. **Geographic variation:** Cases concentrated where practitioners believed in it
5. **Disappearance:** "Epidemic disappeared when practices stopped"

### ICD-10 Recognition
The International Classification of Diseases states: "This disorder is rare, and controversy exists about the extent to which it is **iatrogenic or culture-specific**"

### Who Was Affected
Patients described as:
- Highly hypnotizable
- "Fantasy-prone"
- "Suggestible"
- Many with Borderline Personality Disorder

## Research Publication Trends

| Decade | MEDLINE Titles on DID |
|--------|----------------------|
| 1970s | 39 |
| 1980s | 212 |
| 1990s | 391 (peak) |
| 2000s | 179 (rapid decline) |

---

## Patient Outcomes

- Patients undergoing DID treatment **got worse, not better**
- Many MPD specialty clinics eventually closed
- Therapist licenses revoked
- The "treatment" appeared to create and reinforce the condition

---

## Why It Spread

1. **DSM recognition:** Official diagnosis legitimized the category
2. **Media influence:** *Sybil*, *The Three Faces of Eve* created public awareness
3. **Therapeutic belief:** Practitioners believed they were helping
4. **Patient suggestibility:** Hypnosis and suggestion created "alters"
5. **Professional networks:** Specialists trained others
6. **Emotional investment:** Both therapist and patient invested in the diagnosis

---

## The Pattern

**Before therapists looked for it:** Rare (~200 cases ever)
**While therapists looked for it:** 50,000 cases
**After therapists stopped looking:** Rare again

The "disease" followed the treatment, not the other way around.

## Pattern Elements (for presentation)

| Element | MPD/DID Epidemic |
|---------|-----------------|
| No objective evidence | Symptoms emerged only during treatment |
| No way to test validity | Cannot objectively verify "alters" |
| Emotion as glue | Care, fascination, professional identity |
| Spread through profession | 50,000 diagnoses at peak |
| Ended in calamity | Patients harmed, clinics closed, licenses revoked |
