## Overview

The lobotomy epidemic was a period from the late 1930s through the 1950s when tens of thousands of psychiatric patients underwent brain surgery intended to cure mental illness by severing connections in the brain's prefrontal cortex. The procedure was celebrated, then abandoned after causing widespread permanent damage.

## Key Figures

### Walter Freeman (1895-1972)
- Neurologist (not a neurosurgeon) who became the primary promoter of lobotomy in the US
- First chairman of the Department of Neurology at George Washington University
- Performed **~4,000 lobotomies** personally, including on patients as young as **4 years old**
- Toured the country in a van nicknamed the "Lobotomobile"
- Had no formal surgical training

### James Watts
- Neurosurgeon enlisted by Freeman to perform early lobotomies
- Eventually broke from Freeman over the latter's increasingly reckless methods

---

## Timeline

- **1936:** Freeman and Watts perform first US prefrontal lobotomy on Alice Hood Hammatt
- **November 1936:** Within 2 months, they had performed 20 lobotomies
- **January 1946:** Freeman performs first transorbital ("ice pick") lobotomy on Sallie Ellen Ionesco
- **1942:** Freeman and Watts had performed 200+ procedures, claimed 63% improvement
- **Early 1950s:** Peak of lobotomy use—nearly 20,000 performed by 1951; 50,000+ total in US
- **1950:** Soviet Union bans lobotomies as "contrary to the principles of humanity"
- **1954:** Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) introduced, offering safe alternative
- **1967:** Freeman banned from surgery after patient Helen Mortensen dies of cerebral hemorrhage

## The Procedures

### Prefrontal Lobotomy (Original)
- Required operating room, surgical team, general anesthesia
- Holes drilled in skull to access brain

### Transorbital Lobotomy (Freeman's Innovation)
- Performed in **under 10 minutes**
- No operating room, surgeon, or anesthesia required
- Patient rendered unconscious via electroshock
- Ice pick-like instrument (orbitoclast) inserted above eyeball
- Mallet used to drive through thin bone into brain
- Cuts made in frontal lobes
- Patient sent home in taxi

Freeman's stated goal: simplify lobotomies so psychiatrists could perform them in psychiatric hospitals without surgical support.

---

## Scale of Adoption

- **50,000+ lobotomies** performed in the US
- **Proportionally more** in the United Kingdom
- **60% of patients were women** (1951 study)
- Freeman performed procedures in **23 states**
- Sometimes performed **25 lobotomies in a single day**

---

## Notable Cases

### Rosemary Kennedy (1918-2005)
- Sister of President John F. Kennedy
- Lobotomized in **1941 at age 23** by Freeman and Watts
- Suffered from mild developmental delays and possible epilepsy
- After procedure: **unable to walk or talk**, severely disabled
- Required institutional care for remaining 64 years of her life

### Howard Dully
- Lobotomized at **age 12** in 1960
- Stepmother convinced Freeman he needed the procedure
- Survived and later told his story in NPR's "My Lobotomy"

## Outcomes and Complications

### Freeman's Own Estimates
- Only **one-third** of his 3,500 lobotomies were successful
- **490 resulted in fatalities** (14% mortality rate)
- ~5% overall mortality rate across all practitioners

### Common Complications
- **Epilepsy** (over 25% of patients)
- Bleeding, brain infection, abscess
- Dementia, intellectual impairment
- Incontinence, obesity
- **Apathy, passivity, lack of initiative**
- Decreased emotional depth
- Loss of personality
- Patients had to be **retaught to eat and use the bathroom**
- **~100 of Freeman's patients** died of cerebral hemorrhage

## Why It Spread

1. **Desperation:** No effective treatments for severe mental illness existed
2. **Apparent results:** Patients seemed "calmer" (though often due to brain damage)
3. **Professional endorsement:** Freeman was celebrated, won awards
4. **Ease of procedure:** Transorbital method could be done quickly, anywhere
5. **Institutional pressure:** State hospitals overcrowded, needed solutions

---

## How It Ended

1. **1950:** Soviet Union bans lobotomies
2. **1954:** Chlorpromazine offers safer alternative
3. **1950s-60s:** Growing criticism within medical profession
4. **1967:** Freeman banned after patient death
5. **Today:** Procedure abandoned; considered medical atrocity

## Pattern Elements (for presentation)

| Element | Lobotomy Epidemic |
|---------|-------------------|
| No objective evidence | "Calmer" conflated with "cured" |
| No way to test validity | No controlled trials before mass adoption |
| Emotion as glue | Desperation, hope, professional pride |
| Spread through profession | 50,000+ procedures, awards for Freeman |
| Ended in calamity | Thousands dead or permanently disabled |
