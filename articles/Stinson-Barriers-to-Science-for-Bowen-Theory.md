## Introduction

This is a look at some problems that appear to be there with Bowen Theory through the lens of pseudoscience.

The specific problems are that Bowen Theory does not enjoy scientific critique through, for example, driving peer-reviewed experimental research aimed at publication in well-respected journals. The claims of Bowen Theory are so big, so deep, that demonstrating them would be worthy of publication. For example, there are any number of predictions in Bowen theory that would warrant publication—and it has not happened.

I believe this is for a lot of the reasons I'll cover in this presentation.

### Observations on the Field

There does seem to be a bias toward older folks in the Bowen Network. Most of the thought leaders, most of the leaders in training, and most of the attendees to the spring conference and annual meetings do seem to be older, quite a bit older.

Related to that—and this is really kind of an opinion—the proportion of people interested in Bowen Theory appears to be fewer engineers or people with formal scientific training, and more people with counseling degrees, therapists, consultants. These tend to not have the kind of training that I'm looking at.

## Part 1: Markers of Pseudoscience

### Karl Popper

Carl Popper is probably the best known author on pseudoscience. He was saying that science is essentially: you have a hunch, you collect data on that hunch, you attempt to predict future observations, and then you put it up for good-faith critique.

He's saying that good theory can't explain everything. The closer it becomes to a belief system, the less it actually has something at stake. A good theory doesn't say what will happen—it says what will NOT happen under certain conditions. The more it prohibits, the better.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly: **ad hoc predictions**—a prediction that only claims to have predicted a result after the fact, or is applied only to a specific case and not in a generalizable fashion—is not proof. That is a form of pseudoscience.

### Murray Bowen on Erosion

In Kerr's book *Family Evaluation*, in the epilogue, Bowen is describing the problem of the erosion of technical terms—when terms like "theory," "hypothesis," and others become more to do with untestable opinions rather than formal science.

When there's this erosion, there's division within the in-group. The people who are already biased are just endlessly dividing and dissecting the existing concepts rather than making contact outside the group—the connection to concepts in other fields and critique specifically.

### Scott Lilienfeld

Scott Lilienfeld, a prominent author on pseudoscience and psychology, is also talking about:

- **The absence of self-correction** — The person making the proposition has to actually provide the proof for the proposition. This is a tradition in English common law: the burden of proof is on the prosecution, not on the defendant.
- **Not seeking peer review at all** — Just putting up propositions to people who are already biased
- **Seeking confirmation rather than refutation** — Goes back to Karl Popper: must prohibit certain observations and risk having an incorrect prediction
- **Absence or overlap with other fields** — Compartmentalization, creating problems that only you know how to solve
- **The use of anecdotal evidence** — Common in religions and belief systems
- **The use of obscurantist language** — Using terms that only the in-group understands
- **Lack of boundary conditions** — For example, in Bowen Theory, triangles are everywhere, in a network of connected triangles. However, when making a prediction, that can't be used to explain away incorrect predictions by saying "it wasn't something in this family, it was actually one generation above."
- **The Rorschach maneuver** — Where "the picture can't be taken out of the context of a full battery." The problem is that any problems in the Rorschach don't stand alone—they depend on the validity of the other instruments. If each part of the system depends on every other part and nothing can be validated independently, then you can always say it was some other part in the system that's the problem.

## Part 2: The Core Problem — Absence of Explicit Predictive Models

This is probably the biggest one: the absence of **explicit predictive models**.

This is a term I had to come up with specifically for Bowen Theory because it is the final requirement of formal science, so far as the rest of the world sees it. The terms have to do with **explicit**, **predictive**, and **models**—each with its own meaning.

### Explicit

It has to be outside the human brain. The calculation of the predictions must occur outside of the human brain so it doesn't depend on you—so that it exists having more to do with the object, the natural phenomenon being observed, than with the observer.

### Predictive

It means that the model is making forecasts about what will happen.

### Model

You're making something that simulates the phenomenon in question. It's not an actual family, it's not an actual weather system—it's a simulation of reality.

### The Requirement

This requirement says that you must know what you're talking about—it must operate as a simulation. This goes back to the Newtonian tradition where Newton actually demonstrated in material form what he was talking about. He left the instructions for the experiment and left the data required to replicate the experiment.

**This requirement implies that hypothesis testing is model building.**

### "Concepts from the Human Brain"

Bowen made contributions about not using "concepts derived from the human brain"—ideas that had more to do with the brain than nature. But a problem that emerged over time was that this became interpreted as meaning you shouldn't use math and statistics, shouldn't use engineering skills. I'm arguing here that it's more complicated than that—you cannot have formal science without doing a formal calculation of prediction.

Formal literally means it has to be in material form. It is the application of engineering skills that requires technical training. For example, if it's a software model, you're going to need skills in software engineering.

**All of the subsequent markers of pseudoscience stem from this one.**

## Part 3: Additional Proposed Markers

### No New Explicit Predictive Models

When someone creates a valuable enough prediction, it is automatically picked up by others who try to improve on it—variations on the theme, attempts to attack the problem from a different angle. This relates to the problem of attracting technical talent—engineers pursuing this theory.

### Attention Decreasing in Model Development

When attention in explicit predictive model development decreases while attention to application increases. Application is about reusing old knowledge, old technology—the focus on the models themselves improving the formal state of the art would be the other end of that spectrum.

### Funny Predicament: Theory Before Model

It's a funny predicament trying to build a predictive model from an already-formulated theory—a theory that's already complicated and sophisticated.

The pure inductive mode is: you observe, you collect evidence, you make a prediction, the prediction requires a model by definition, then you put it up for debate. The theory is based on the model.

Instead, I find myself in the situation of trying to find a complicated model from the theory itself. The theory is generated by the experimental research—that's the pure inductive mode.

### No Replicability

This doesn't mean it HAS been replicated—it means it's POSSIBLE to attempt to replicate it. This stems from:
- No formal format for how to collect new data (no data model)
- No generalizable instructions for experiment
- Ad hoc instructions rather than generalizable ones

### Meditation-Like Practice to Learn

I actually enjoy this quite a bit personally. Bowen Theory requires meditation-like practice to learn rich concepts—something that requires solitude and reflection to understand.

But formal science has to be based on explicit predictive models—it has to be based on that which is demonstrable and easily communicable. It doesn't take 3 years just to learn the theory if it's formal.

### Reference to Seminal Thinker vs. Models

Mandatory reference to a seminal thinker, as opposed to the models themselves.

### Circular Definitions

Definitions within an in-group where one concept depends on another concept that depends on the first concept.

For example, "consciousness" is usually defined with some other term like "awareness" or "experience," but those definitions depend on consciousness. If someone thinks consciousness has been defined objectively, I would ask them to show a definition that's not circular.

### Conflating Construct with Value

Assuming that a concept in a theory is equivalent to a belief system. This goes back to Hume's is-ought problem—science tries to describe how things work in a predictive way, while value systems are subjective opinions about what to do with it.

## Part 4: Application to Bowen Theory

### The Biggest Flaw

There is no evidence that there is a single explicit predictive model for Bowen Theory itself.

It's common to refer back to the Nim study and the regression. The instructions given to staff for certain very low functioning people—that was actually a pretty interesting explicit predictive model in that experiment. But that alone can't bear formal weight for Bowen Theory as a whole.

For example, "a child in a family receives the majority of the anxious focus and that has something to do with the management of tension and anxiety"—the evidence for this is a logical consequence. It occurred to me probably two years ago: **if there were explicit predictive models that work, the market of ideas is such that they take the stage, not the mythology of the theory.**

It would not be the mythology of the Nim project, Murray Bowen himself, his characteristics and values—it would be about the actual models and the state of the theory.

### Conflating Differentiation with Value

I propose that Bowen Theory has conflated the idea of differentiation of self with an actual human value.

The problem with differentiation of self as a human value is that if it's always good, then there's no way to predict when it's not occurring. There are a million different definitions, too complicated to be a predictive device. Try to come up with an objectively measurable definition for differentiation—the functional self, separating the feeling system from the thinking system—it's an idea, a really interesting one, but not objectively measurable.

Counter-examples help differentiate science from value: sometimes too much differentiation causes problems in the body; too much differentiation too fast results in the change-back response. These examples help make it scientific because they establish boundary conditions rather than saying "this thing is always good."

### "Based on Facts Alone"

This is a common phrase Bowen wrote. Many take this for granted—that the theory is an attempt to explain observational facts from the Nim project and subsequent projects.

The term "fact" has eroded itself. In formal science, **a fact is a universal belief**—something good enough to be set aside to focus on other things. It's just something we take as a provisional truth, easy enough for everybody to accept.

When that term "fact" is eroded down into things that are more a matter of opinion, it moves away from science. Things become polarized because it's one person's opinion versus another's—it loses its universal depolarizing power.

## Part 5: Academic Barriers

### Must Differentiate Personal Research from Formal Research

There must be a distinction between research on one's own family and formal scientific research. When folks around here say "research," most people think it's scientific in the formal sense—but it has to be differentiated.

Someone applying research principles to becoming more objective about their extended family multigenerational system is different from formally verifiable predictions that make their way into an explicit predictive model with multiple sample sizes where researchers are not so close to the data.

**If research is biased towards one's own family and away from formal research, then there will just be less progress in the formal research.**

That doesn't discount the importance of research on one's own family. The goal is to become objective about one's automatic behavior. But it is not reasonable to expect that kind of "research" to result in formal verifiable research. If I'm ever wrong about this, I would love to see it—I would love to be proven wrong.

### Disconnection from Greater Academic Field

Over-reliance on peers within a closed system. Terms like "general systems theory," "cybernetics," "cause and effect"—the use of this term in Bowen Theory means linear causality that doesn't include feedback loops.

These terms are in the past as far as the greater field of research sees it. Using antiquated terms indicates being out of touch with the rest of the field.

Each one of these terms does point to real problems in the field at large that still exist. But the precise understanding of what those problems are has moved forward in the academic world.

### Use of Jargon

The terms anxiety, differentiation of self—these have specific technical meanings that are not quite the same as individualism, not quite the same as anxiety always being negative. This causes semantic issues in conversation with people outside the Bowen network.

## Part 6: Strengths of Bowen Theory

### Problems the Broader Field Ignores

Bowen Theory proposes things that the broader field has yet to contend with.

**The family is involved in individual functioning.** A person's functional position in their family system is descriptive of their ability to move through life's problems with more or less efficient use of resources, more or less progress or regression. You can't understand a person's functioning without researching their functional position in the family.

This is a big claim, and the field has yet to contend with it.

### Over-Focus on Helping

The predominance of people who possess the value of "care and harm"—preventing harm and taking care of people—leads to being soft towards people rather than being more strict or aggressive in a productive sense.

Bowen Theory is making the claim that it's actually easier to overhelp than it is to truly help someone in the long run.

### Attachment Theory Limitations

Attachment theory is the de facto clinical theory—secure attachment is the goal. But there is no nomenclature in the attachment literature for a parent giving too much attention to a child, attention that has more to do with the parent's own anxiety than with what the child needs.

### Implicit Clinical Theories

There is a problem that theories that clinicians actually use are implicit—not written down, just intuitive. This is going to mean that many things a clinician does are actually an expression of something that remains implicit, has more to do with acting on impulse than formal prediction.

This represents a mismatch between evidence-based practice and reality.

## Part 7: The Challenge

### Focus on Explicit Predictive Models

I propose here that you get immunity against pseudoscience strongly when the focus is on explicit predictive models. You've got to build a simulation of the phenomenon at hand.

If someone claims to understand how the human family works, I've got to see the artifact you built that simulates a human family. The degree of claim and strength of the claim can only be backed up by what's in that simulation.

**Formal research is not equal to (!=) research on one's own family.** Formal research is the kind that's funded, the kind that meets the criteria the rest of the world is using.

### The Challenge to Believers

I challenge anyone who believes Bowen Theory to be factual (even if not verified) to:

1. **Make a case presentation under 3 minutes** — Ideally 2 minutes
2. **Include only the minimum necessary data** — Really clean argument
3. **Present to a good-faith critic** — Like a physicist who doesn't already believe in Bowen Theory
4. **Use a generalized formula, not ad hoc** — One that applies literally word for word to another family
5. **Repeat with 3 more cases** — Prove it's there

Put all together: make that data clean, present it to someone who doesn't share the bias, and do it multiple times with multiple cases. Prove that it's there, that it actually replicates. If that can be done, I would love to see an example.

## Conclusion

That's all I've got. You can find the app at familydiagram.com. I think the more data that gets entered, the better—doesn't even have to be paid for. And I would love to see more explicit predictive models.

Thank you very much.
