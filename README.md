## What This Conference Is About

Treatment has increased fourfold. Prevalence hasn't budged. The problem: we're studying the blade of grass, not the wind. This conference shifts the lens to the family and introduces the framework and technology to capture what we've been missing.

This conference presents a path forward:



1. **A minimal data model** (SARF: Symptom, Anxiety, Relationship, Functioning) that captures family emotional process
2. **A research method** (Inter-Rater Reliability) to establish whether trained people can agree on what they're seeing
3. **Technology** that scales human judgment without replacing it
4. **Practical tools** you can use in your practice
