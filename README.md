## What This Conference Is About

**The core question:** How do we know if what we're doing helps—or makes things worse?

Behavioral health lacks the measurable foundations that other fields take for granted. Without measurement, practices spread based on what feels right, not what works. History shows where this leads: lobotomy, recovered memory therapy, and other catastrophes where caring professionals harmed the people they intended to help.

This conference presents a path forward:

1. **A minimal data model** (SARF: Symptom, Anxiety, Relationship, Functioning) that captures family emotional process
2. **A research method** (Inter-Rater Reliability) to establish whether trained people can agree on what they're seeing
3. **Technology** that scales human judgment without replacing it
4. **Practical tools** you can use in your practice

The family is the smallest system where patterns become visible. By shifting the unit of analysis from individual to family, we can begin to measure what has been unmeasurable.

## Key Ideas

### The Problem

- Treatment for depression increased 4x from 1987-2007. Prevalence stayed the same or increased.
- After first depressive episode, 50% relapse. After third, 90%.
- Teen suicide deaths increased 62% from 2007-2021.
- Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study: boys who received caring intervention had *worse* outcomes—more crime, more addiction, earlier death.

**Without measurement, caring can hurt.**

### The Proposal

Shift the unit of analysis from individual to family. The family is the smallest system where emotional patterns are visible—one level up from the blade of grass.

SARF provides a minimal vocabulary:
- **S**ymptom — What's happening in the body or behavior
- **A**nxiety — Perceived uncertainty + urgency
- **R**elationship — Toward/away movements between people
- **F**unctioning — Capacity to pursue goals

### The Research Method

**Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR):** Can trained people agree on what they're seeing?

If experts can't agree on coding, the concepts aren't clear enough. If they can agree, we have ground truth—a foundation for training, certification, and research.

### The Technology Vision

**IRR + AI is the breakthrough.**

AI needs one thing: examples that humans agreed on. IRR provides exactly that. Technology scales what humans validate; humans remain the authority. Every output is reviewable and correctable.

**Two eras:**
1. **Era 1 (now):** AI learns to replicate what humans agreed on
2. **Era 2 (coming):** AI discovers patterns in the growing database that humans couldn't see
