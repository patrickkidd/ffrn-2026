**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025 | 1:15-2:15 PM**
**Duration:** 60 minutes (including Q&A)

## Status

**Current state:** Presentation notes complete ([3-PRESENTATION-NOTES.md](3-PRESENTATION-NOTES.md)). Demo case (Martin family) designed with interview-order data entry, "aha" moment, follow-up inquiry, and R → A → S formulation.

## Todo

- [x] ~~Decide: how to show the app~~ → **Live demo from blank.**
- [x] ~~Choose demo case scenario~~ → Martin family, 5 people, 8 events
- [x] ~~Identify "aha" connection~~ → 7-month cascade ending in son's panic attacks
- [x] ~~Draft outline with timing~~ → [3-PRESENTATION-NOTES.md](3-PRESENTATION-NOTES.md)
- [ ] Practice demo flow 2-3 times for timing
- [ ] Prepare verbal backup if tech fails
- [ ] Test screen share on Zoom

## Purpose

**The one window to showcase what the Family Diagram app can do.** Live demo: enter data in interview order, show animated emotional process, land the "aha" connection, explain the formulation. Laura follows with a full clinical case.

## Core Message

**Enter the data. See the process. Find what you missed.**

## Demo: Martin Family

**Presenting problem:** Matt (16) has panic attacks. Parents say school stress.

**Interview-order entry (3 phases):**
1. "What brings you in?" — Matt's symptoms, family structure (Karen, Jim, Sarah)
2. "What's going on in the family?" — Karen/Jim conflict, Karen toward Ruth, Sarah left
3. "Tell me about Karen's family." — Ruth, Ruth's cancer diagnosis

**"Aha":** Scrub 2018 chronologically. The data came in jumbled; the timeline reveals the sequence. Panic attacks are the last domino.

**Follow-up:** Ask about Ruth's diagnosis → client reveals emotional energy around it, doesn't connect to Matt's symptoms.

**Formulation:** Ruth's diagnosis → Karen toward Ruth / away from Jim → marital conflict → Sarah leaves → Matt symptomatic. R → A → S.

## Risks

- Live demo tech failure — need verbal backup
- Non-technical audience — accessible language
- Overlap with Laura — Patrick: blank → data → insight; Laura: full case analysis
