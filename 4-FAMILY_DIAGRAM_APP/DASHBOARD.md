# Presentation 4: The Family Diagram App

**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025 | 1:15-2:15 PM**
**Duration:** 60 minutes (including Q&A)

## Status

**Current state:** Brainstorm v3 (`2-BRAINSTORM-APP-SHOWCASE.md`). App capabilities + live demo are the centerpiece. Patrick enters data from scratch, shows animated emotional process, lands an "aha" connection on the timeline. Laura Havstad follows with a full clinical case.

## Todo

- [x] ~~Decide: how to show the app~~ → **Live demo from blank.**
- [x] ~~Choose demo case scenario~~ → `DEMO-CASE.md` (Martin family, 5 people, 8 events)
- [x] ~~Identify "aha" connection~~ → 7-month cascade ending in son's panic attacks
- [ ] Practice demo flow 2-3 times for timing
- [ ] Prepare verbal backup if tech fails
- [ ] Draft final outline with timing

## Priorities

1. Demo case scenario + "aha" moment selection
2. Final outline with timing
3. Practice runs

## Purpose

**The one window to showcase what the Family Diagram app can do.** Live demo: enter data, see animated emotional process, notice a connection on the timeline you didn't see before. Laura follows with a full clinical case.

## Core Message

**Enter the data. See the process. Find what you missed.**

## Key Themes

1. **Live demo: blank → data → animated process → "aha" connection.** CENTERPIECE.
2. **Diagram + Timeline** — the two backbones; what makes it different from a genogram
3. **Capabilities overview** — SARF built in, toward/away, custom variables, filtering, presentation mode
4. **Facts/functional facts** — brief practical context for what goes on the timeline
5. **App Seminar** — community of practice

## Connection to Day's Arc

**Pres 1-3 (Morning):** Problems, framework, research infrastructure — all abstract
**Pres 4 (This one):** The tool. Enter data, see process, find what you missed.
**Pres 5 (Havstad):** Full clinical case in the app

## Key Lines

- "Everything we talked about this morning lives in this app."
- "A family diagram that moves through time."
- "You can watch 40 years of a family in 5 minutes."
- "Before this, you had to animate emotional process in PowerPoint."
- "The app doesn't teach you Bowen theory. It shows you where your understanding breaks down."
- "Record the shift, not the judgment."

## Outline Snapshots

| File | Status |
|------|--------|
| `0-INITIAL_BRAINSTORM.md` | Superseded |
| `1-BRAINSTORM-FACTS-CENTERPIECE.md` | Superseded (over-indexed on methodology) |
| `2-BRAINSTORM-APP-SHOWCASE.md` | Superseded (too verbose) |
| `3-PRESENTATION-NOTES.md` | **Current** - Concise presentation notes |

## Risks

- Live demo tech failure — need verbal backup
- Demo "aha" needs to feel organic, not staged
- Non-technical audience — accessible language
- Overlap with Laura — Patrick: blank → data → insight; Laura: full case analysis
