# Presentation 4: The Family Diagram App — Brainstorm v2

**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025 | 1:15-2:15 PM**
**60 minutes (including Q&A)**

**Changes from v1:** Removed demo/screenshots section (Laura Havstad covers live walkthrough in Pres 5). Elevated facts/functional facts to centerpiece of the presentation. Compressed toward/away. Reframed as conceptual "what the app is and why it matters" rather than visual walkthrough.

## Position in the Day

| Presentation | Core Question | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Why Family | Why does this matter? | Problem |
| 2. SARF | What do we measure? | Framework |
| 3. Clinical Research | How do we research it? | R&D |
| **4. Family Diagram App** | **What is it, and why does a timeline of facts change everything?** | **Conceptual + Practical** |
| 5. Havstad Clinical | What does it look like in action? | Live demo + evidence |
| 6. Future | Where does it lead? | Vision |

Laura Havstad handles the live walkthrough. This presentation sets up *what the app is conceptually* and *why the discipline of facts matters* — so when Laura shows the case, the audience understands what they're looking at and why it's significant.

## Core Message

**A timeline of facts is the foundation of everything.**

The app is a timeline of facts tied to a family diagram. That's it. The simplicity is the point. Everything this morning — SARF, ground truth, IRR, AI — rests on whether the facts going in are actually facts. The app enforces that discipline. And the functional fact is the tool that converts feelings and opinions into something factual.

## What This Presentation Is NOT

- Not a live demo (Laura covers that next)
- Not a software tutorial
- Not a technical architecture talk
- Not a sales pitch

## What This Presentation IS

- **The case for facts as the unit of clinical data**
- How a timeline of facts forces systems thinking
- What a functional fact is and why it's the secret weapon
- How the app enforces the discipline the field has always needed
- Setup for Laura's live demonstration

## The Centerpiece: Facts, Functional Facts, and the Conversion

### Why Facts Matter (connects to morning)

This morning we established:
- Facts calm people down (Pres 1 — common currency analogy)
- Without measurable concepts, ideology fills the vacuum (Pres 1 — catastrophes)
- SARF gives us categories to track (Pres 2)
- Ground truth = what domain experts agreed on (Pres 3)

All of this depends on one thing: **the quality of what goes in.** If the data aren't facts, nothing downstream works — not SARF coding, not IRR, not AI training, nothing.

### What Is a Fact?

A fact is something everyone can easily agree on.

- "John was born on March 14, 1965" ← fact
- "Mary and John divorced in 2001" ← fact
- "Tom was fired from his job in September 2015" ← fact
- "Mom and Dad stopped speaking to Uncle Bill in 1998" ← fact

These are dates and events. They're the skeleton of a family's history. Nobody argues about whether a birth happened.

### What Is NOT a Fact?

- "My mother never liked me"
- "I never got along with my sibling"
- "We don't talk to Dad's family because they're toxic"
- "He's always been the responsible one"
- "She's narcissistic"

These are subjective impressions. They might be accurate — but they're not facts. You can't put them on a timeline and have two independent people agree on what they mean.

**This is where most clinical data lives right now.** Opinions, impressions, labels. The morning showed where that leads.

### The Functional Fact: The Conversion Tool

Murray Bowen introduced the idea of a **functional fact** — and this is the secret weapon.

**A functional fact converts a feeling or opinion into something factual by recording the fact that the shift occurred, not the content of the shift.**

Examples:

| What the person says | Not a fact | The functional fact |
|---|---|---|
| "My mother never liked me" | ✗ | "Contact with mother decreased starting ~2003" |
| "He became a completely different person" | ✗ | "His political orientation shifted from X to Y around the diagnosis" |
| "She had a terrible dream" | ✗ | "She reported a disturbing dream the night before the birth" |
| "Things got really bad between us" | ✗ | "Frequency of arguments increased from monthly to daily in Q3 2018" |
| "He's the black sheep of the family" | ✗ | "Family contact with him dropped after 2010; he was excluded from holiday gatherings starting 2012" |

**The conversion:**
1. Take the subjective impression
2. Find the observable shift underneath it
3. Record the shift with a date (or at least an order)
4. Drop the judgment, keep the movement

This is not just a data hygiene trick. **This is the move from ideology to measurement.** Every catastrophe this morning involved people treating impressions as facts and acting on them. The functional fact is the tool that prevents that.

### Why This Conversion Is Hard

- People are anxious when they report (Pres 2 — anxiety impairs cognition)
- Subjective impressions *feel* more true than bare facts
- The richness of a story feels lost when you strip it to shifts and dates
- Clinicians are trained to track feelings, not events

But the richness isn't lost — it's *organized*. You still have the story. Now you also have a skeleton of facts that anyone can verify, critique, or build on.

### The Cascade: Facts → Timeline → Systems Thinking → Pattern

1. **Gather facts** — strip impressions to observable shifts
2. **Put them on a timeline** — even approximate dates force ordering
3. **Ordering forces systems thinking** — you start seeing what preceded what
4. **Systems thinking reveals pattern** — R → A → S becomes visible
5. **Pattern enables critique** — someone else can look at your timeline and disagree *about the facts*, not just about interpretations

This is exactly what the app does. It's a container for this discipline.

## Draft Structure (Revised)

### I. Opening: From Abstract to Concrete (3 min)

Connect to morning:
- This morning: the field is broken, here's a framework, here's research infrastructure
- All of it depends on one thing: **the quality of the data going in**
- If the data aren't facts, nothing works
- *"The app is a timeline of facts tied to a family diagram. That's the whole thing."*

### II. What the App Is (5 min)

Two backbones:
- **Diagram**: Who is who. Reproductive structure. Relationships.
- **Timeline**: What happened. When. In what order.

What makes it different from a genogram:
- A genogram is static — a snapshot
- The app is dynamic — the diagram changes as you move through time
- SARF variables are built in
- The timeline *is* the data

Not a drawing tool. A data discipline.

### III. The Case for Facts (15 min) — CENTERPIECE

**A. What is a fact?** (3 min)
- Something everyone can easily agree on
- Dates, events, observable shifts
- Connect to Pres 1: "Facts calm people down" — common currency

**B. What is NOT a fact?** (3 min)
- Subjective impressions, labels, interpretations
- Examples from real clinical language
- "This is where most clinical data lives right now."

**C. The functional fact — the conversion tool** (6 min)
- Bowen's concept: record the fact that a shift occurred
- Walk through 3-4 conversions (impression → functional fact)
- "You strip the judgment. You keep the movement."
- The conversion IS the move from ideology to measurement

**D. Why this is hard — and why it matters** (3 min)
- Anxiety impairs reporting (connects to SARF "A" variable)
- Feels like losing the richness of the story
- But: the richness isn't lost, it's organized
- Without this discipline: one opinion vs. another → tribal hierarchy

### IV. What Happens When You Do It (10 min)

**The cascade:**
- Facts → timeline → ordering → systems thinking → pattern → critique

**The discovery everyone makes:**
- Experienced Bowen practitioners enter a case and find their data has gaps
- Happens in almost every case
- The app doesn't teach Bowen theory — it shows where your understanding breaks down
- *"The app demonstrates the real work to be done"*

**The responsibility pattern** (brief — connects to Pres 3):
- Two interviews, data organized on timeline
- Person sees pattern for first time: always picking up responsibility, anxiety only going up
- *"Just seeing the data organized was the breakthrough."*

**Critique becomes possible:**
- With facts on a timeline, a colleague can look at your case and disagree about facts — not just about feelings
- This is how science works: *"I suspect I see a pattern here. Here is my data. Find the faults."*

### V. Toward and Away (5 min — compressed)

Brief introduction — don't go deep:
- Every complex pattern is built from two moves: toward another person, or away
- Phone call = toward. Canceling = away. Argument = two towardsop simultaneously.
- A triangle = toward one, away from another, at the same time
- These are trackable. They go on the timeline. They're facts.
- Daily logging: track your own moves, see things you've never seen

*"These are still being refined. But the point is: even the most complex emotional processes reduce to simple, observable, factual moves."*

### VI. The Tools (7 min)

**A. The Pro App** (2 min)
- Released and available
- Timeline + diagram + SARF variables + toward/away
- For clinicians, coaches, researchers
- alaskafamilysystems.com/family-diagram

**B. The Personal App** (3 min)
- In development
- AI-assisted conversation generates timeline + diagram
- Makes the fact-gathering process accessible to anyone
- Creates case file the Pro app opens
- The morning's R&D (SARF, IRR, AI) feeds directly into this

**C. The App Seminar** (2 min)
- Monthly Zoom — community of practice
- Frame: falsifiable thinking + data collection
- Anyone can bring a hunch — everyone suffers the burden of proof
- Best case so far: Dr. Havstad — which is what you're about to see

### VII. Handoff to Havstad (2 min)

- Everything I've described is conceptual — what the app requires, what facts are, why it matters
- Dr. Havstad is going to show you what it looks like when someone does it well
- *"This is the state of the art."*

### VIII. Q&A (10 min — may be longer if Laura's demo is shorter)

Likely questions:
- "Do I need Bowen training to use it?"
- "How is this different from a genogram?"
- "What if I don't have dates?"
- "How do I join the seminar?"

## Key Lines (Revised)

- "The app is a timeline of facts tied to a family diagram. That's the whole thing."
- "A fact is something everyone can easily agree on."
- "You strip the judgment. You keep the movement."
- "This is where most clinical data lives right now — opinions, not facts."
- "The functional fact converts a feeling into something factual."
- "The app doesn't teach you Bowen theory. It shows you where your understanding breaks down."
- "Just seeing the data organized was the breakthrough."
- "Without facts, it's one opinion against another. That defaults to whoever has the most power."
- "I suspect I see a pattern. Here is my data. Find the faults. That's science."

## Connections to Morning (Explicit Callbacks)

| Morning Concept | How It Returns Here |
|---|---|
| Facts calm people down (Pres 1) | Facts are literally the unit of data in the app |
| Common currency (Pres 1) | A timeline of facts is common currency for a family case |
| Ideology fills the vacuum (Pres 1) | Without facts, impressions fill the vacuum — same mechanism |
| Anxiety impairs cognition (Pres 2) | Why fact-gathering is hard — people can't report straight when anxious |
| R → A → S pipeline (Pres 2) | The timeline is where you see the pipeline play out |
| Ground truth (Pres 3) | Ground truth starts with facts, not impressions |
| "Just seeing the data organized" (Pres 3) | Same example returns — now framed as "what happens when you do this" |

## Risks / Weak Points

- **15 min on facts could feel preachy** — needs examples, pace, audience engagement. Don't lecture about facts; show the conversion in action.
- **Toward/away at 5 min might feel tacked on** — could cut entirely, or weave into the "what goes on a timeline" section as one more kind of fact.
- **Personal App honesty** — need to be clear it's in development without deflating.
- **Risk of repeating Pres 1 material** — callbacks are intentional, but the audience might feel like they're hearing "facts matter" again. Solution: keep callbacks brief, focus on the *conversion tool* as the new content.
- **No visuals** — since Laura handles the demo, this presentation is mostly talking. May need at least a few slides (the conversion table, the cascade, etc.) to keep visual engagement.

## Open Questions

1. Toward/away: keep as separate section, weave in, or cut?
2. Personal App: what's the honest status?
3. How many slides? Even without demo, probably need 10-15 minimal slides.
4. BT Co-pilot: include or save for Pres 6?
