# Presentation 4: The Family Diagram App — Brainstorm v3

**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025 | 1:15-2:15 PM**
**60 minutes (including Q&A)**

**Changes from v2:** Facts/functional facts demoted to supporting context. App capabilities + live demo are the star. Removed Personal App and BT Co-pilot sections — this presentation is about the Family Diagram app.

## Position in the Day

| Presentation | Core Question | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Why Family | Why does this matter? | Problem |
| 2. SARF | What do we measure? | Framework |
| 3. Clinical Research | How do we research it? | R&D |
| **4. Family Diagram App** | **What can this thing do?** | **Showcase** |
| 5. Havstad Clinical | What does a real case look like? | Clinical application |
| 6. Future | Where does it lead? | Vision |

This is a showcase. The audience needs to see what's possible. Laura follows with a specific clinical case. Patrick shows the tool itself.

## Core Message

**Enter the data. See the process. Find what you missed.**

The app is a family diagram that moves through time. You enter facts, and patterns become visible — including connections you didn't see before. That's the value-add.

---

## What This Presentation Is NOT

- Not a methodology lecture
- Not a deep technical dive
- Not a software tutorial (step-by-step how-to)
- Not a specific clinical case (Laura covers that)
- Not about other products (Personal App, BT Co-pilot — save for Pres 6 if at all)

## What This Presentation IS

- A showcase of what the Family Diagram app can do
- Grounded in practical context (facts/timeline give it meaning)
- Climaxes with a live demo: enter data → see animated process → notice a connection you missed

## Draft Structure

### I. Opening: This Is What We Built (3 min)

Connect to morning:
- This morning: problems, framework, research
- Now: the tool
- *"Everything we talked about this morning — SARF, timelines, ground truth — lives in this app."*

Brief description:
- A family diagram that moves through time
- SARF variables built in
- Available now — alaskafamilysystems.com

### II. The Two Backbones: Diagram + Timeline (8 min)

**The Diagram:**
- Family structure — who is who, how they're related
- Emotional process symbols on the diagram (conflict, distance, cutoff, fusion, etc.)
- This part is familiar to anyone who's drawn a family diagram before

**The Timeline:**
- Births, deaths, key events — automatically compiled
- You fill it out with everything that matters: hirings, firings, cutoffs, resolutions, diagnoses, moves
- The diagram and the timeline are linked — the diagram changes as you move through time

**What makes it different from a genogram:**
- A genogram is a snapshot — frozen in time
- This is dynamic — you can watch a family's history unfold
- The timeline IS the data; the diagram is the visualization

**Practical grounding (brief — not a lecture):**
- What goes on the timeline: facts. Dates and events people can agree on.
- When you have a feeling or impression, the functional fact converts it: record the *shift*, not the judgment
  - "Things got bad" → "Arguments went from monthly to weekly starting June 2018"
  - "He became a different person" → "His involvement in the family dropped after the diagnosis"
- This keeps the data clean enough that someone else could look at your timeline and follow it

### III. Showcase: What You Can Do (25 min) — CENTERPIECE

Two parts: a brief tour of capabilities, then a live demo that lands the value proposition.

**Part 1: Capabilities Overview (8 min)**

Not a feature tour — just enough so the audience knows what they're looking at during the demo.

- **Animated timeline** — the diagram changes as you move through time. Emotional process symbols appear and disappear. *"You can watch 40 years of a family in 5 minutes."*
- **SARF variables built in** — track S, A, R, F over time alongside life events. The pipeline from this morning — you can see it play out.
- **Toward and away** — simplest moves on the diagram. Toward one, away from another = a visible triangle.
- **Custom variables** — not locked into SARF. Add your own columns. Define what you track.
- **Filtering** — filter by person, event type, date range. This is where patterns jump out.
- **Presentation mode** — the app can present a case in 3-5 minutes. This is how Laura is about to show hers. *"Before this, you had to animate emotional process in PowerPoint."*

**Part 2: Live Demo (15-17 min) — THE PAYOFF**

**Format:** Patrick enters a few data points from scratch, live. Not a pre-loaded case — building it in real time so the audience sees the workflow.

**The arc:**
1. Start with a blank diagram. Add a few family members — parents, a couple of kids. Quick.
2. Add a handful of timeline events — a death, a cutoff, a conflict, a symptom onset. Just enough to populate the timeline.
3. Show the animated view — scrub through the timeline, watch the emotional process symbols appear on the diagram. The audience sees the family's process unfold.
4. **The "aha" moment:** While looking at the data organized on the timeline, notice a connection that wasn't obvious before — a relationship shift that preceded a symptom, or a cutoff that lines up with a change in functioning. Something that was sitting in the data but only becomes visible when you see it laid out in order.

**Why this works:**
- The audience watches data entry happen — it's not magic, it's accessible
- The animated view is the visual spectacle — this is what no other tool does
- The "aha" moment is the value proposition in action: *the app shows you things you didn't see*
- It demonstrates the cascade: facts → timeline → ordering → connection you missed

**Prep needed:**
- Patrick needs a case scenario ready — real or composite, simple enough to enter in ~5 min
- The "aha" should be genuine but reliable — pick a scenario where the connection is clear once the data is laid out
- Test the demo flow 2-3 times to nail the timing
- Have a backup plan if tech fails (describe what they would have seen)

**The discovery everyone makes:**
- This happens to experienced practitioners every time — they enter a case they think they know and find gaps
- *"The app doesn't teach you Bowen theory. It shows you where your understanding breaks down."*

### IV. The App Seminar (5 min)

**What it is:**
- Monthly Zoom — community of practice
- Frame: falsifiable thinking + data collection projects
- Anyone can bring a case — everyone holds each other to the data

**What it does:**
- The explicit format makes real critique possible
- You bring your timeline, someone else can say "I don't see the data for that claim"
- Best case so far: Dr. Havstad — which you're about to see

**How to join:** alaskafamilysystems.com

### V. Handoff to Havstad (2 min)

- I've shown you what the app can do
- Dr. Havstad is going to show you what it looks like when a clinician uses it on a real case
- *"This is the state of the art for presenting emotional process with data."*

### VI. Q&A (15 min)

Likely questions:
- "Do I need Bowen training to use it?"
- "How is this different from a genogram?"
- "What platforms does it run on?"
- "How do I join the seminar?"

## Key Lines

- "Everything we talked about this morning lives in this app."
- "A family diagram that moves through time."
- "You can watch 40 years of a family in 5 minutes."
- "Before this, you had to animate emotional process in PowerPoint."
- "The app doesn't teach you Bowen theory. It shows you where your understanding breaks down."
- "Record the shift, not the judgment."
- "This is the state of the art for presenting emotional process with data."

## Showcase Format: DECIDED

**Live demo.** Patrick enters data from scratch, shows animated view, lands the "aha" connection.

Distinct from Laura's presentation: Patrick shows the tool and the workflow (blank → data → insight). Laura shows a fully built clinical case and walks through the analysis.

**Prep checklist:**
- [ ] Choose demo case scenario (simple, 4-5 family members, ~6-8 timeline events)
- [ ] Identify the "aha" connection in advance (reliable but not forced)
- [ ] Practice the entry flow 2-3 times for timing
- [ ] Prepare verbal backup if screen share / app fails

---

## Risks

- **Live demo tech failure** — Zoom screen share, app crash. Need verbal backup ready.
- **Overlap with Laura** — Patrick shows blank → data → insight; Laura shows full case analysis. Need clean distinction.
- **Non-technical audience** — accessible language throughout. "Animated timeline" not "timeseries visualization."
- **Toward/away may not land** — if audience doesn't know Bowen, the triangle concept needs a 30-second setup. Morning SARF intro should cover this.
- **Demo "aha" needs to feel organic** — not staged. Pick a scenario where the connection is genuinely non-obvious until laid out.

## Open Questions

1. Demo case scenario: which case/composite gives a clean "aha" in ~5 min of data entry?
2. Does toward/away need more setup for non-Bowen audience, or is the SARF intro from the morning sufficient?
