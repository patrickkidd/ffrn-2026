# The Family Diagram App — Presentation Notes

**1:15-2:15 PM | 60 min | After lunch, before Havstad**

---

## I. Opening (3 min)

- Connect morning's abstract material to this concrete tool
- "Everything we talked about this morning lives in this app."
- Available now: alaskafamilysystems.com/family-diagram

## II. What It Is (8 min)

**Diagram + Timeline — linked.**
- Diagram: family structure + emotional process symbols
- Timeline: facts — births, deaths, cutoffs, shifts, events
- Diagram changes as you move through the timeline
- Not a "genogram" (static snapshot, no predictive model)

**What goes on the timeline:**
- Facts and functional facts — record the shift, not the judgment
- Brief, 1-2 examples max. Audience context, not a lecture.

## III. Capabilities (8 min)

Quick tour so the audience knows what they're about to see:
- Animated timeline — watch a family's process unfold over decades
- SARF built in — S, A, R, F trackable over time
  - R shifts, e.g. triangles - show triangles view
- Filtering — by person, event type, date range
- Presentation mode — how Laura will show her case next

## IV. Live Demo: The Martin Family (17 min)

### Setup

"A 16-year-old named Matt is having panic attacks. His parents say it's school stress. Let's enter this family the way the data actually comes in — from an interview."

### "What brings you in?" — Presenting problem

| Kind | Person | Date | SARF / Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| Shift | Matt | Oct 2018 | S: up. A: up. "Panic attacks" |
| Birth | Karen (Jim) | 2003 | child: Matt |
| Birth | Karen (Jim) | 2000 | child: Sarah |

### "What's going on in the family?" — Recent process

| Kind | Person | Date | SARF / Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| Shift | Karen | May 2018 | R: conflict, target: Jim. A: up. "Arguments" |
| Shift | Karen | Apr 2018 | R: toward Ruth. A: up. "More contact with mom" |
| Moved | Sarah | Aug 2018 | "Left for college" |

### "Tell me about Karen's family." — Extended family surfaces

| Kind | Person | Date | SARF / Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| Birth | Ruth | 1945 | — |
| Shift | Ruth | Mar 2018 | S: up. "Cancer diagnosis" |

Tidy-arrange diagram as structure events settle.

### The "aha" — scrub through 2018

Switch to animated view. The data came in jumbled — now the timeline puts it in order for the first time.

**Mar: Ruth's diagnosis → Apr: Karen toward Ruth → May: Karen/Jim conflict → Aug: Sarah leaves → Oct: Matt's panic attacks**

"None of this came in this order. The interview jumped around. But the timeline shows the sequence. The panic attacks are the last thing that happened, not the first."

### Follow-up inquiry on triggering event - Cancer Dx

When you see a connection like this on the timeline, the next move is to ask about it. You ask about Ruth's diagnosis — not "did it cause the panic attacks," just an open question. And what typically happens is the client reveals there was a lot of emotional energy around that event. They don't connect it to Matt's symptoms — they usually don't. But they'll tell you Karen was on the phone with Ruth every day, that Jim felt shut out, that the house was tense. That goes in the notes. The timeline pointed you where to look; the follow-up confirms whether there's something there.

### The formulation — what the timeline is showing

Ruth's cancer diagnosis introduced acute anxiety into the system — perceived uncertainty and urgency. Karen automatically shifted toward her mother, which pulled her away from Jim and the nuclear family. That destabilized the marriage: conflict rose. Sarah left for college, removing another person who had been absorbing tension in the household. Matt is now the only child with two anxious, conflicting parents. The anxiety that originated one generation up — from Ruth's diagnosis — channeled through the relationship shifts and landed as a symptom in the most vulnerable remaining member.

R → A → S. The relationship shifts modulated anxiety upward; the symptom appeared at the end of the chain. If you only look at Matt, you treat teenage anxiety. If you look at the family timeline, you see the process.

## V. App Seminar (5 min)

## VI. Handoff → Havstad (2 min)

## VII. Q&A (17 min)
