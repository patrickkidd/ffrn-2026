# Presentation 4: The Family Diagram App — Initial Brainstorm

**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025 | 1:15-2:15 PM**
**60 minutes (including Q&A)**

---

## Position in the Day

| Presentation | Core Question | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Why Family | Why does this matter? | Problem |
| 2. SARF | What do we measure? | Framework |
| 3. Clinical Research | How do we research it? | R&D |
| **4. Family Diagram App** | **How do YOU do it?** | **Practice** |
| 5. Havstad Clinical | What does it look like? | Evidence |
| 6. Future | Where does it lead? | Vision |

This is the pivot from abstract to concrete. The audience has spent the morning being told the field is broken and shown a framework and research infrastructure. Now they need something they can actually touch.

## Core Message

**The app forces the work that theory has always required but never enforced.**

Constructing a timeline and diagram isn't new to Bowen theory. What's new is that the app makes you do it explicitly — and that explicitness exposes gaps in what you think you know about a family.

---

## What This Presentation Is NOT

- Not a software tutorial (they can watch videos for that)
- Not a deep clinical case (Havstad follows with that)
- Not a technical architecture talk (morning covered the R&D)
- Not a sales pitch disguised as a presentation (though promotion is woven in)

## What This Presentation IS

- A demonstration of what changes when you formalize what Bowen theory has always described
- A walk through the thinking process the app requires
- Enough to make someone want to try it

## Key Themes from Source Material

### 1. Timeline + Diagram = The Two Backbones
- The diagram shows structure (who is who, how related)
- The timeline shows process (what happened, when, in what order)
- Neither can be avoided — the app requires both
- Merely constructing a timeline forces clarity about what is known vs. unknown

### 2. Facts vs. Functional Facts
- Timeline should only contain facts
- Easy to confuse subjective impression with fact
  - "My mother never liked me" ← not a fact
  - "Mother and I stopped speaking in 2003" ← fact
- Functional facts (Bowen's term): the *fact* that a subjective shift occurred
  - "She had a dream" is a fact; the dream's meaning is not
  - "His political orientation shifted" is a fact; which side is "right" is not
- This distinction is the foundation of data quality

### 3. The App Forces Systems Thinking
- Putting events in chronological order is a major step toward systems thinking
- Systems thinking = thinking in terms of how processes play out over time
- Most experienced Bowen practitioners discover gaps in their data when they try to enter it
- "The app demonstrates the real work to be done"
- The explicit format makes critique possible

### 4. Toward and Away as Atomic Operations
- Candidate atomic operations of emotional process
- Phone call = toward. Argument = two simultaneous towardsop. Ghosting = away.
- Daily logging reveals things never seen before
- Falsifiable: can track whether triangles actually form with sufficient tension

### 5. The App as Inductive Tool
- First goal: remove technical barrier to collecting and presenting concise inductive arguments
- Static 2D diagram doesn't communicate dynamic process
- The app: family diagram that changes in accordance with a timeline
- Can present a concise 3-5 minute argument for an induction with data
- Simplifies communicating emotional process to people unfamiliar with theory

### 6. Personal App (AI Intake) — Coming Soon
- AI chatbot generates timeline and family diagram through conversation
- Makes data collection accessible to anyone (not just Bowen-trained)
- Creates case file that Pro app can open
- Intake tool for clinicians — structured, consistent

### 7. App Seminar — Community of Practice
- Monthly Zoom sessions
- Frame: falsifiable thinking + project suitable for data collection
- Equalizer: everyone suffers the burden of proof
- Entry requirement: define a falsifiable prediction
- Best example: Dr. Havstad's "Blue" case (upcoming presentation!)

## Draft Structure

### I. Opening: From Theory to Practice (3 min)

Connect to morning:
- This morning: the field is broken (Pres 1), here's a framework (Pres 2), here's how to research it (Pres 3)
- Now: here's how you actually do it
- *"Everything I showed you this morning lives inside this tool."*

### II. What the App Is (5 min)

Two backbones:
- **Diagram**: Reproductive structure + emotional process symbols
- **Timeline**: Chronological facts — births, deaths, cutoffs, shifts

The key innovation: the diagram changes as you move through the timeline. You can watch a family's emotional process unfold over time.

Not a genogram tool. Not just a drawing tool. A data collection and presentation tool.

### III. The First Step: Constructing a Timeline (10 min)

This is where the real work happens.

**What goes in:**
- Facts: births, deaths, hirings, firings, divorces, cutoffs, resolutions
- Functional facts: that a shift occurred (not whether the shift was "right")
- Get dates where you can; get the order right where you can't

**What stays out:**
- Subjective impressions presented as facts
- Interpretations
- "My mother never liked me" vs. "Contact with mother stopped in 2003"

**The discovery everyone makes:**
- Experienced practitioners enter a case and discover their data has gaps
- Happens in almost every case
- The app doesn't teach you Bowen theory — it shows you where your understanding breaks down
- *"Just seeing the data organized was the breakthrough."* (from Pres 3)

### IV. What the App Shows You (10 min)

Walk through what it looks like — screenshots or brief demo:

1. **The diagram view** — family structure with emotional process symbols
2. **The timeline view** — chronological events, filterable by person/type
3. **The animated view** — diagram changes as timeline advances
4. **Custom variables** — track anything (SARF variables built in)

**The "Responsibility Pattern" example** (from Pres 3):
- Two 45-minute interviews
- Person sees for the first time: constant pattern of picking up responsibility
- Saying yes to everything, no filter
- Anxiety going up and up. No downs.
- *"Just seeing the data organized was the breakthrough."*

### V. Toward and Away: The Atomic Operations (8 min)

Simplest possible explanation:
- **Toward**: any move toward another person (phone call, argument, visit)
- **Away**: any move away (canceling plans, ghosting, quitting a job)
- Every complex pattern in a family is built from these two moves
- A triangle = toward one person, away from another, simultaneously

Daily logging:
- Track your own moves
- Reveals things you've never seen — even in well-known systems
- Forces you to define what you're tracking before you track it
- *"You can't receive critique without data, without examples."*

### VI. The Personal App: AI-Assisted Intake (7 min)

What's coming:
- AI chatbot conducts structured intake conversation
- Generates timeline + family diagram from the conversation
- Creates a case file the Pro app opens
- Makes family assessment accessible to non-Bowen-trained clinicians

Why it matters:
- Lowers the barrier to entry dramatically
- Consistent, structured data collection
- The morning's R&D infrastructure (SARF, IRR, AI) feeds directly into this

### VII. The App Seminar (5 min)

What it is:
- Monthly Zoom — community of practice
- Frame: falsifiable thinking + data collection projects
- Anyone can bring any hunch — everyone suffers the burden of proof

What it does:
- The explicit format makes critique possible
- Exposes gaps that would otherwise stay hidden
- Best example so far: Dr. Havstad's case — which you're about to see

**Transition to Havstad:** *"Dr. Havstad is going to show you what a well-constructed case looks like in the app. This is the state of the art."*

### VIII. Getting Started (2 min)

- Download the app: alaskafamilysystems.com/family-diagram
- Construct a timeline on paper first (births, deaths, key events — just get the order right)
- Enter it into the app
- Join the App Seminar if you want to take it further

### IX. Q&A (10 min)

Likely questions:
- "Do I need Bowen training to use it?"
- "How is this different from a genogram?"
- "What does the Personal App cost?"
- "How do I join the seminar?"

## Key Lines (Candidates)

- "Everything I showed you this morning lives inside this tool."
- "The app doesn't teach you Bowen theory. It shows you where your understanding breaks down."
- "Just seeing the data organized was the breakthrough."
- "Constructing a timeline is a major step toward systems thinking."
- "You can't receive critique without data."
- "A fact is something everyone can easily agree on. Start there."

---

## Screenshots/Visuals Needed

- Family diagram view (with emotional process symbols)
- Timeline table view
- Animated diagram advancing through timeline
- Toward/away symbols on diagram
- Personal App mockup or concept (if available)

---

## Risks / Weak Points

- **Too much ground to cover in 60 min** — toward/away and daily logging may be too much detail for this audience. Could cut or compress.
- **Overlap with Pres 3** — the "responsibility pattern" example was already mentioned. Need to be explicit that this is the same example, now shown in the app.
- **Demo risk** — live demos fail. Screenshots are safer. The question is whether screenshots convey the animated timeline experience.
- **Non-technical audience** — toward/away as "atomic operations" is STEM language. Need to translate: "the simplest possible moves."
- **Personal App doesn't exist yet** — need to be honest about timeline without killing excitement.
- **Havstad handoff** — need clean transition, not stepping on her content.

## Open Questions

1. Live demo vs. screenshots? (Screenshots safer, but miss the timeline animation)
2. How much toward/away detail? (Could be its own presentation — may overwhelm here)
3. Personal App status — how concrete can we be about timeline/availability?
4. Should we show the BT Co-pilot feature? (Covered in AI article, but may be too technical)
5. How much time for Havstad setup vs. app content?
