# Anxiety as a Core Concept in Animal and Human Adaptation

# Abstract

The term anxiety is a core part of Bowen theory yet is defined slightly differently than in today’s popular vernacular. Current popular definitions rely on subjective descriptions to enable psychiatric diagnoses and billing for medical services. This paper attempts to lay out a definition of anxiety suitable for recording volumes of data on what Bowen theory calls *emotional process*. The idea of the anxious response representing a search path, the conditions for this as a sufficient combination of uncertainty and urgency, and theoretical implications are explored. 

# Prelude: The Problem of Theory in Psychology as Science

The scientific discipline of Psychology is typically defined as the prediction and control of human behavior \[APA ref\]. It is a soft science insofar as it does not produce virtually perfect prediction.

The hard sciences are ultimately defined by precise predictions. Any discipline can be a science so far as it *reaches toward* the example of the hard sciences. Precise prediction is the result of removing subjective impressions from the kinds of definitions and models employed by a science.

At the core of any specialized scientific discipline is the theories that declare what is known about the area. Theories are man’s best impression of how something works. They are flawed and incrementally improved to be more precise.

A theory with perfect precision becomes a law. Even laws become deprecated as new theories or laws predict more and even better than before. This is the evolutionary process of human knowledge. It is a feature both of the ignorance of man and of his striving.

The definition of Psychology as the prediction and control of human behavior places the discipline squarely in the frame of the hard sciences. However, precision in this discipline is still very low because the integrative clinical theories that attempt to organize large swaths of human functioning into a single, integrative framework contain far more subjective impressions than mechanical reality.

This imprecision is most easily visible in the operational definitions of technical terms. Even the term “psychology” itself is often claimed by folks who think, speak, and write in terms antithetical to the hard sciences. The plurality of these views are certainly a wondrous and necessary part of the evolution of human knowledge. They are views that *feel* correct and are taken as *true* but do not enjoy the mechanical predictive instruments that remain the hallmark of the hard sciences.

Many or maybe even most professional psychologists, known as counselors, therapists, clinicians, healers, etc., use these mostly subjective ideas in their daily professional practice. In fact, insofar as these professional fields exist, they *must* use these views because the field of Psychology does not possess theories that describe a very broad range of phenomena and models that make precise enough predictions to be called “scientific.” This state of the field reflects the state of current knowledge of human functioning. We have very much to learn.

In time the term “Psychology” will certainly differentiate into increasingly specialized terms that pertain more directly to either one of these two modes. Until then, a prelude like this is necessary to clarify which mode is in use.

This paper lands square in the frame of the hard sciences. The sole aim of this frame is to predict the most useful aspects of human behavior with mechanical precision. That day may never come, but this aspiration distinguishes science as the engineering of human knowledge from philosophy and opinion that muses and speculates.

# Anxiety as a Technical Term

The term anxiety is pre-loaded with cultural and personal meaning. Current definitions depend on subjective, i.e. imprecise, descriptions \[DSM/etc refs, existence or nonexistence of inter-rater reliability refs\]. The level of subjectivity in these terms poses a problem when using the term for the recording of high quality data.

The diagnostic definitions used today have most to do with a subject’s opinion that they are having feelings they would rather not have relating to terms like distress, often associated with arousal via the HPA access \[ref\], etc. Central in the term is the subject’s wanting the feelings to go away. Under this definition, a person cannot logically be said to have anxiety if they are satisfied with their emotional state.

These definitions make very little contact with the kind of scientific frame that this paper is reaching toward. It is not possible to build mechanical models from these terms that demonstrate what this “anxiety” *is*, even if through mere analogy. The definition is tied to the human experience. It is not useful without a human subject that is experiencing it, which means that it is literally tied to subjective opinion. This literal level of subjectivity is a barrier to scientific precision.

Thus, a larger step back from existing thinking must be taken to begin to stitch together a more objective definition.

An objective definition would guide the collection of quantitative data and construction of mechanical models that behave as closely as possible to the human. Raw observations used to formulate inductions would have to be plain and factual to the human eye, or somehow mechanically recorded. Speculation may reach far from such a basis, but never abandon it.

# A Definition of Anxiety

The first axiom in evolutionary theory is that organisms strive primarily for the propagation of their kind into the future. Each species has material and environmental conditions required for survival. At the very least, any behavioral science of living things attempts to at least predict the process of procuring such conditions.

A cornerstone concept in such predictions could be the degree of *error* in such processes. Error would be the rate at which a known process to obtain such conditions misses the mark. It can be assumed that an organism’s goal is to reduce this level of error in essential processes as much as possible. No assumption is yet made about a single *end* goal or *ideal* state for an organism, but merely that these processes occur and that they are more or less successful under varying conditions.

A second cornerstone concept is that these processes unfold as a chain of *decisions*. All living matter has behavior, and behavior is defined as following one of a many potential pathways at any given moment. Will heart rate increase, decrease, or stay the same? Will a nest of honeybees move to candidate nest site A, B, or C? Raw observations for such processes are recorded in *time series*, where each decision in the series consists of a timestamp, a set of potential subsequent actions, and which action was actually chosen.

Many samples of such time series can be used to train statistical models that take the current step as input and assign probabilities to each possible next step. The probabilities for each possible pathway in a given step always add up to 100%. This kind of model is called a *Markovian* model.

In other words, it’s like a maze where each fork in the road has weighted probabilities and the goal is to model, i.e. predict, how the subject would run the maze under specified conditions. 

This Markovian decision system models a complex system because the effect of one choice has a compounding effect on each subsequent choice. You can run such a model many times giving different predictions from slight changes in conditions. This is how models are run many times to converge on a prediction for the weather, airplane performance, or investment strategy.

Each step in a time series is here called a *decision*. This basic framework can be used to systematically *infer* what is predictable in the behavior of any system, living or non-living. The act of collecting observations and proposing a pattern among them is called *induction*.

Induction is the heart of science. In the noun form of the term, the proposed pattern itself is called one *induction*. Drawing a hypothetical prediction from the induction is called *deduction*. Testing inductions with predictions deduced from them is what distinguishes science as the engineering of knowledge from other manners of accumulating knowledge.

A field of Psychological Science aimed at the prediction and control of human behavior would seek to produce decision models. A field of Psychological Science grounded in evolutionary biology would primarily seek to model the evolved processes of survival. A field of Professional Psychology would apply these models to specific cases of patients achieving their goals.

Of special importance would be the prediction and control of the conditions under which error increases. Of particular interest in this paper is the particular automatic, i.e., “biological” response to *a sufficient combination of uncertainty and urgency*. This response can be called *anxiety*.

Consider a crude robot that must find its way through a maze. This robot is aware of its coordinates in a maze at any given moment and can also record its own path through a maze. The maze changes often and so the robot must continually rediscover the correct way through the maze. In other words, it must adapt by making best use of current and past knowledge to make predictions about the future.

We can add *urgency* as an independent variable to this mechanical model. As urgency increases, the robot increases its speed. It can carry out its search through the maze up to a certain speed before it starts hitting the walls and potentially damaging itself or the maze, running out of energy from poor efficiency, etc. In other words, the constraints of its own structure and function begin to run up against the constraints of the maze environment.

The fact that the robot does not know the way through the maze implies a degree of *uncertainty.* However, we can add an uncertainty amplifier as a second independent variable to the model. Let’s say this variable increases error in the instrument that knows the current coordinates in the maze and also increases the time required to choose between forks in the road. This crude uncertainty amplifier simulates the increasing simplification of the decision-making mechanism in an organism as urgency increases.

Such a model allows us to experiment with varying levels of uncertainty and urgency. When there is enough of each, the compounding error from poorer data, slower decisions, and traveling too fast can eventually cause entirely new problems in themselves. Wheels will wear with more friction, motor brushes will wear prematurely, the robot may never find its way out of the maze from repeating choices known to be incorrect or endlessly cycling between trajectories derived from incorrect location data.

If all attention goes into repairing such secondary problems then the primary problem will go unchanged. The primary problem is, of course, the accuracy and efficacy of the robot’s decision-making algorithm itself. The secondary problems will resurface indefinitely so far as they draw attention away from the decision algorithm. The decision algorithm can be called the robot’s *psychology*.

The human’s evolutionary ancestors were more constrained by the degree of mismatch between their “psychology” and the constraints of their environment. Their own biological responses remained relatively fixed as environmental uncertainty and urgency increased and decreased around them.

The psychology of the hypothetical robot consists of the *rules* that determine the decisions it makes. These rules could include an ability to know when realistic limitations in the robot’s own functioning are exceeded and to change course accordingly. That is, to work smarter instead of merely working harder. This factor would at least decrease some of the wasteful side effects that do not have benefits.

A second factor would be to increase the level of sophistication of the algorithm. This could include increasing the number of data inputs, the number that could be considered at once, the speed at which they are considered, and so on. Most of all, it could include the predictive model that takes all of this information and predicts which of each set of immediate choices will yield the best outcome.

In other words, to increase the level of detail involved in its decisions. 

Perhaps another dimension of sophistication could be predicting more than one step ahead. Maybe the algorithm could consider multiple potential scenarios after three, four or five steps. This dimension could be called *foresight*. Longer foresight is a key feature of the cortical capacity of the human \[ref\].

Despite this difference, a human’s biological response to sufficient levels of uncertainty and urgency is still almost identical to that of other animals, and possibly even cells \[ref\]. That is, to increase energy output along a set of specialized behaviors to decrease uncertainty and/or urgency. Eyes open wide, hearing becomes more acute, heart rate increases, blood rushes in from the limbs to support functions in the core, palms become sweaty, seconds feel like minutes, many sensory data are filtered out while a select few are amplified, and so on.

All of this is automatic. It is a conservative regression that has proved the statistically best option in the widest possible conditions through eons of the evolutionary past. Just as the mechanical systems are primed to *act,* a person’s reality is molded to act with *certainty*.

All of this represents a scripted set of rules inherited from the human’s genetic lineage. It follows from a temporarily constructed, oversimplified reality that is appropriate for simple but decisive *action*. Run from the Lion. Freeze to blend in. Attack the aggressor. Reproduce now because it may not be possible later \[ref\].

But in this view, the key difference between humans and the rest of life is the ability to change the script. To change the psychology. A new script can be more flexible in its decisions or bypass inefficient steps or wasteful decisions. A human is indistinguishable from an animal under the highest levels of anxiety. Under less anxiety, a human looks less like an animal but like something else entirely.

That difference between the human and the animal is something analogous to a software level that rests on top of a hardware level. The hardware level is that predictable part that is shared increasingly with the rest of life. Generally speaking, the software level provides more flexibility, more *choices* at each step in the time series of decisions. Both levels adapt through an evolutionary process in the formal sense, but the hardware level follows the slow clock of the rest of life while the software level can change in leaps and bounds within a single generation or even a single decade.

The software level of the human is enabled in large part by the differentiation, or specialization, of the cortical areas of the brain \[ref\]. Of particular interest are the abilities to inhibit *emotion* and consider points further into the future. These are functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) \[ref\]. Emotion, defined here as any automatic behavior derived outside the processing of information in the PFC, appears, at least subjectively, to be mutually exclusive with the function of the software layer.

Anxiety as defined here is one category of emotion. *In a nutshell, as anxiety goes up, complex thinking goes down.* A function of anxiety is to inhibit thinking so as to fall back on an older, simpler script. Thinking in terms of function is essential to applying this definition of anxiety properly.

# A Key Difference: Thinking in Terms of Function

A key difference with this view of anxiety is that it proposes a *function* of anxiety. Thinking in terms of function is in line with evolutionary thinking. Importantly, this helps avoid polarities and biases and gets one to think in terms of *systems* instead of ideas that pertain only to human experience.

A system is defined as any set of components where a change in one necessitates a change in another. Under this definition, studying biological systems consists of defining the set of Markovian decisions that an evolved system makes through time. This frame eliminates the qualitative difference between the psychology of simpler organisms versus more complex organisms. This frame also suggests a single quantitative continuum along which the psychology, or capacity for cognitive function \[refs for Noone’s cognition in cells\], of organisms differ.

The name and character of this continuum will be left up for speculation. Cognition in this sense merely means decision making whether driven by emotion in systems of bacteria \[ref\], cells \[ref\], or by “thinking” in the human.

Thinking in terms of function forces one to define the ideal outcome of a behavior. Any effect other than this function can be categorized as either *error* or yet another function. A proposition here is that anxiety is the mobilization of energy and narrowing of perceptual attention, including attention on a particular way of evaluating the immediate environment, which *functions* to enable decisive action. 

Polarized debates occur when a behavior is seen as either all good or all bad. This is particularly the case when human behavior is in question. One side argues the function while the other side argues the error. Neither can “see” both at the same time.

A balanced systems view differentiates function and error so that the dialog can shift to cutting the wheat from the chaff, so to speak. Then attention can go to promoting the function while reducing the error. After all, error is waste, and it happens that if the debate can calm down enough then most folks will agree on what is and is not error and that error is undesirable.

A key difference in this definition of anxiety is that it is not necessarily a bad thing. Anxiety is seen as having a function that is vital to the survival of the organism. It is only any associated error in achieving that function that is undesirable.

It is suggested here that anxiety functions to mobilize energy toward a search path to reduce uncertainty that has arisen. The search path is the predictable hardware algorithm, the set of rules, that have evolved over eons. It is the average conservative response that has worked over evolutionary time. 

Anxiety is driven by urgency and dissipates once a solution is found, or once real or perceived urgency decreases. While the anxious response functions to reduce uncertainty, it often has many side-effects outside that function that can be categorized as error. 

This error can be directed into many different behaviors. Some divert this energy to the cognitive structures leading to higher intelligence, some to the physical structure as somaticized diseases or exceptional fitness, some to an unproductive flailing through one or more of the menu of psychiatric disorders.

Thinking in terms of function makes it easier to differentiate an organism that is quite active, always on, functioning rapidly, highly productive, i.e. consistently hitting the mark, from one who merely has *distress*. Under this definition, an organism can either like or dislike this response, and it can be either productive or unproductive.

Therefore this definition cannot be compared with the concept of *pathology*. The takeaway is that the human can optional utilize the flexibility of their software layer to sometimes correct the inflexible hardware response when appropriate. In other words, the goal is to decrease anxiety to increase psychological function so that energy mobilized as anxiety can better hit the mark.

The topic of whether anxiety is desirable or not is a subtle one and requires introducing the concepts of positive and negative emotion.

# Positive and Negative Emotion

One aspect of the effect of thinking in terms of function is the relation between the behavior and appraisal of the behavior. By and large, Clinical Psychology attends to controlling behaviors that the subject finds undesirable. This is negative appraisal, or negative *evaluation*. Evaluation is integral to every emotional response.

A term for the phenomenon of evaluation itself that is congruent with current thinking of the field is *negative emotion*. Its opposite is *positive emotion*. Current thinking is that all emotion contains at least two values; a positive or negative *valence,* and an *intensity*. These terms positive emotion and negative emotion are highly useful in the view of anxiety proposed in this paper. While the idea of emotional valence has not been demonstrated to exist with mechanical precision \[ref\], it is so useful that it is practically an axiom in evolutionary psychology.

The term *evaluation* has been carefully chosen. It is literally the assignment of positive or value to a sensory datum. Value is simply whether the organism indicates an approach or avoid response and to what degree this response occurs. It is assumed that all organisms issue value in a mostly scripted manner. Some are more flexible in this evaluation than others.

The topic of subjective evaluation and its position in a theory of emotion is a complex topic that will not be covered here. But for this paper it is important to outline the position of emotional evaluation in this view of anxiety because the most common uses of the term anxiety today involve negative appraisal.

In common parlance, the anxious subject dislikes the behavior enough to avoid it. Evaluation of this new view of anxiety can also be positive. There can also be no evaluation, which is considered an ignorant or totally automatic response.

An area of speculation is precisely how an organism decides where to channel or divert the energetic response to a perception. One way or another, this decision is assumed to divert toward behaviors that are more or less productive.

Maturation requires an optimal amount of anxiety by definition. It is automatic for a parent or supervisor to over function for those they are responsible for bringing up. An appropriate level of anxiety spurs innovation in the maturing person. In other words, necessity is indeed the mother of invention.

This highlights the function of anxiety speculated in this paper. That function is to find a solution to an urgent problem. Learning and maturation is a process of discovering and retaining solutions to common problems.

In this view, anxiety itself is not necessarily good or bad. It is an automatic, evolved response to a sufficient combination of uncertainty and urgency. In humans it remains more common with the rest of life than different from it because it has proven productive for eons.

The goal for the human is to decrease the over-correction of the evaluative system in the anxious response. Over-correction, or over-evaluation, is error in the function of anxiety. This occurs by inhibiting automatic impulses to allow one’s observational abilities to kick in. As more new information comes in, choice emerges. The software layer, the psychological layer, has updated itself.

A person can better develop their ability to update their software layer. But it requires diligent practice. This begins with observing one’s own automatic reactions particularly when interacting with or thinking about other people.

A function of anxiety is to steer perceptions toward singular, automatic action. One cannot simply act if one does not believe the reality implied by the action is *true.* A goal in this view of anxiety is for each subject to become aware of whether they are acting out of automatic impulse or whether they are acting out of deliberate action in every moment.

# Anxiety as a Search Path

A hypothesis in this view is that anxiety functions to *find* a solution to a problem. It does so by initiating what is called a *search path* in computer science. This may not be mere analogy but a direct conceptual description. That a search path is occurring is evident when the automatic response stops as soon as a piece of *information* is found.

In this case, uncertainty has decreased below a critical threshold. There is no change in material space, for example the physical structure of the organism or the food procured, but there has been change in *information space*. A bit has changed somewhere in the neural network of the brain.

There is then another factor involved in the response. The search path initiated by the anxiety must in fact find a solution. This often does not occur. Many organisms’ search paths will simply not result in a solution to a lethal problem.

A technical term for this mismatch between search path and reality may be termed simply, *ignorance*. Some organisms are far simpler than others, and other organisms are quite sophisticated but not in the appropriate way. At either extreme is ignorance of the solution to a problem.

The role of ignorance and its opposite, *omniscience,* is an axiom, not a fact. It is a view that biases towards accurate knowledge of the objective world. As with any bias, it functions to tease out the merits of such a view. It is not a comprehensive, factual view of the world that negates opposing views but merely one that has utility for a particular set of problems. One such utility is the ability to organize observations of, and ultimately predict, the adaptive behavior of organisms.

For example, hunting is only possible because one species can know that another is in danger while the hunted one does not. A hypothesis is that the human adapted to outrun animals in Southern Africa \[ref\]. At first this sounds ridiculous as images of gazelles or cheetahs loping across the savannah depict humans as some of the slower moving organisms of the animal kingdom. But the human can tire out many animals at slow speeds, carrying water for hydration, cooling more efficiently with asynchronous breathing, and most importantly thinking far enough into the future than the animal’s scripted, short-term anxious response allows.

The human approaches in bursts at a moderate pace. The animal reactively evades the human at a similarly moderate pace. After an endless series of moderate bursts, the animal eventually collapses without realizing there is a pattern in these sporadic movements. Their search path merely contains the action: find safety *away*.

It is a mostly open question how an organism responds when ignorance is at play. However, it appears as though attention will be diverted to some acceptable target once anxiety exceeds some discomfort threshold. The shift to a new target decreases the uncertainty and so brings the level of anxiety back down to an acceptable level.

A new target can be just about anything such as food, exercise, violence, position or current or future position in a human hierarchy, and so on. It is not completely clear how a diverted target is chosen. It is assumed this decision does follow an evolved script and that it can be represented by a markovian set. But this is currently merely an axiom, not a fact.

As an example, a person is surprised when they catch an unhappy glance from a boss at work. The mind begins racing to explain the negative emotion from the boss. My performance has been good. Or has it? Does that mean I don’t actually know how to evaluate my performance? Was the boss actually looking at me or someone behind me? Questions upon questions come forth as part of the search path.

If this person’s anxiety reaches a high enough level, they but go home to drink more beer than normal or give in to gossiping with a spouse about their mother. A new search path was initiated, and it found resolution. The target of anxiety as diverted to one with less uncertainty. The person’s system avoids some catastrophic meltdown but fails to solve the problem that can cause a meltdown in the future. There is no apparent relationship between the new target and the old target of anxiety.

The problem of attention diversion makes it difficult to systematically address the problem of anxiety. While the process of anxiety has only shown a minor shift, one content of anxiety can be utterly unconnected to another content of anxiety. Therefore, a specialized evaluation methodology is required to tease apart the impact of anxiety in a particular case.

# Attention and Diversion, The Timeline Methodology

Anxiety steers attention in particular directions. As intensity increases, attention becomes less sophisticated. It becomes lower resolution and gets stuck on a target more easily. As this occurs, the likelihood of the target or targets of attention being farther from the actual source of anxiety often increases.

This is a wonderfully curious phenomenon. Most interestingly, current thinking in Clinical Psychology appears to follow this pattern itself by dividing attentional targets of anxiety into categories. Each new category of anxiety comes with its own new clinical specialty. There is separation anxiety, food anxiety, anxiety of closed spaces, anxiety of open spaces, death anxiety, life anxiety, start of job anxiety, end of job anxiety, generalized anxiety, etc. \[DSM ref\] As is the case with arbitrary categorization, this dividing has no bounds. What’s more, there is no formal way to directly relate any one category to any one medical problem.

The main point is that this way of thinking, this categorization, is arbitrary. It is intuitive but has never been substantiated by predictive models as is required for any scientific discipline. In other words, there is no explicit theory guiding the selection of valid categories.

The view of anxiety in this paper is one attempt to steer attention away from arbitrary categorization of attention targets and back to the more basic process of reactivity that generates the anxiety itself. One reason for this is that it is much easier to objectively track a factual *process* of anxiety regardless of the target of its attention.

Part of this way of thinking about anxiety is demonstrating how anxiety impacts a symptom in a clinical case. A differential diagnosis often produces a limited set of possible diagnoses, each with different probabilities. A single identified “cause” is not always given. This is because 1\) the actual problem is not yet clear, and 2\) there is often great variation between problems between people. In other words, “everybody is different.”

A treatment plan then consists of trial and error with different interventions to help discover the “cause.” Of course, many problems are the result of multiple factors combined together. Each factor is more like a coefficient, an amplifier, in an algebraic equation than a root cause. Thus, it is quite useful to think about anxiety as an amplifier for other factors.

One way to systematically pick apart the role of anxiety in a particular symptom or syndrome is to construct a timeline comparing shifts in symptomatic expression with shifts in events presumed to modulate anxiety. Identifying shifts in symptoms is often easy enough but the key utility of this definition of anxiety is to help identify events that modulate it.

Current thinking in Clinical Psychology and in Western culture at large does not provide a clear way to identify events that modulate anxiety using the definition in this paper. In this definition, one pays attention to events where important problems must be solved quickly. Problems that implicate close relationships in some way, especially familial relationships, are of primary interest.

One example of acute anxiety is physical pain. Often intense negative evaluation of a physical problem, i.e., *pain*, presents an urgent problem that requires an immediate solution. Pain can easily send acute anxiety through the roof.

Other events generate anxiety, like a sudden increase in persistent tension in a relationship, meeting the family of a new love interest, losing a job, losing a house, a child diagnosis, and so on. An intense argument with a child, sibling, parent, aunt/uncle, or grandparent might result in a shift up in chronic anxiety.

A detailed timeline that tracks shifts up or down in symptom(s) along with shifts in anxiety can help account for the impact of anxiety in the symptom(s). Or it can help see the impact of anxiety in the efficiency through which symptoms are dealt with.

Problems are dealt with quite inefficiently when anxiety steers the subject’s attention away from the facts and the process of anxiety itself. One of the most interesting paradoxes of this phenomenon is the fact that the *content* of anxiety, that is the worries and targets of attention, are never quite wrong. Anxiety effectively produces a series of “Yeah but what if…” statements about a problem. At the extreme end is what is subjectively called fear. Objectively, extreme fear leads to paralysis \[ref\].

It is intuitive to jump to rational reasoning against the “yeah, but what if…” arguments of an anxious person. This is usually only plays into the process of anxiety itself. Once a formal or informal diagnosis is placed, the target of attention can become prohibitively fixed away from the process.

For example, it is a valid fear that you could die driving down the highway? It is certainly possible. Is it a valid fear that you could forget your wallet and then run out of gas, and that it could happen in a bad part of town, and on and on? Certainly. Anxiety about large-scale public problems like the COVID pandemic can be particularly difficult because there are an infinite array of contradictory facts available to support any anxious mode of the problem. The anxious mind is constantly running its search path and finding new dangers to raise the alarm for. It is certainly more effective at finding them than the well-meaning calm person attempting to help. Therefore, the reliable recourse for the calm person is to focus on the process of anxiety and hold one’s own opinion unswayed by the anxious opinion.

This definition of anxiety provides a single, universal variable that applies in all these cases. It simplifies the collection of data and analysis of each case to the degree it is accurate. It provides one of many factors to control for in any persistent problem.

# The Timeline Methodology: A Case Example

As a scientific/inductive discipline, medical assessment always begins with a compilation of the facts. It is essential that this step occurs free of any analysis of what the facts mean. Indeed, which facts are collected is guided somewhat by the theory associated with the provider’s specialty. With the exception of the selection bias, the compilation of facts must be as dispassionate and objective as possible. Maintaining this objectivity is purely the responsibility of the assessor and requires constant effort.

One patient was terrified of sex. A cluster of tangled, incoherent fears would emerge before, during, and after sex with her partner. She had lost her virginity a couple of years before in her mid 30’s and had a history of urinary tract infections with her previous, and first, partner. The infections stopped immediately after the relationship ended.

She reported that she had an unusually small vagina because she had vaginal pain during and after sex. She would report pain after sex as if there were fire ants in her vagina. Her breasts would seem larger at times, and she would be afraid she was getting pregnant. She was visibly fearful of any potential medical problem including fear of any small bump on the skin, incontinence which became a problem during work hours, nausea, increase or decrease in desire for food, extreme seasonal nasal allergies that coincided with the stress of the end of the school year, and so on.

The above list of facts would be included in an any medical assessment by a medical professional with some eye for behavioral health, though likely in less detail. The concept at work in this assessment was guided in part by the definition of anxiety presented here. The key assumption is that the physical systems’ overall ability to adapt to *any* problem is impacted by anxiety under this definition. A theoretical step back is required here before applying this definition of anxiety to interpret and expand upon the above facts.

## Applying The Concept of Anxiety

After the full range of pertinent facts are gathered, it may be divided into *factors*. Factors include the full range of physiological factors with anxiety as the fundamental behavioral factor. Many physiological factors can be ruled out with blood tests, imaging, and other medical tests. Evaluating the role of the anxiety factor requires a timeline and a clear methodology because it is a *latent* or *hidden* variable at this stage of scientific knowledge.

A latent variable is one that is not directly measurable. Instead, it must be inferred from other directly measurable variables. Some instantaneously measurable variables are related to anxiety such as blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol levels, cytokine activity \[ref\], etc. But these do not capture the important parts of the concept such as baseline level of anxiety, chronic level, acute level, etc.

The idea of absolute level of anxiety is only hypothetical and is currently not measurable. But the concept can be quantified in terms of relative shifts up and down. As an example, heart rate has an absolute value such as 120bpm and so it also has relative deltas such as an increase of 10bpm or a decrease of 15bpm.

A timeline of the problem should be a part of any medical assessment of a complex problem. Relative shifts up or down must be inferred from factual observations on a timeline. The timeline can assign absolute values between 0.0 and 1.0 relative to no anxiety and the highest shift up over the course of the timeline. This allows the level to be graphed and compared with other measurable variables.

During this interview, the concept of anxiety merely provides an additional factor to gather information about. However, unlike most physiological factors, questions about anxiety must be interlaced into questioning about the standard questions about more isolated physiological problems. This requires a basic shift in thinking for the medical professional. Anxiety must be seen as a basic coefficient underlying the system’s ability to adapt, not an additional, isolated variable with its own diagnostic section. This adds a little more time to the basic medical interview but a trained assessor can still perform the interview in a reasonable amount of time.

Anxiety is assumed to be a coefficient that amplifies existing physical problems and increases error rate in cognition. Under this definition, anxiety impacts *everything*. Some cases may indicate anxiety as a major factor and others may indicate anxiety as an irrelevant factor. The question is not whether anxiety is implicated but how much.

The interviewer watches for key indicators of anxiety during the interview. Current neurological research supports the threat response having predictable impact on the cognitive system \[ref\]. Namely, increased threat response means cognition becomes less complex, faster, more focused on existing mental impressions rather than updating existing mental models with new information from the environment, and so on. In short, the threat response is something of an acute regression toward animal behavior in that it is less flexible and more scripted.

This is observable in the qualitative character of the *process* of thinking, i.e., *how* the person thinks, not necessarily the *content* of thinking, or *what* is thought. Behavioral assessment evaluates processes by definition. Defining an effective qualitative scale for the *process of thinking* that regresses with the threat response is a needed task of research psychology.

The assessor evaluates the patient’s ability to present a concise, coherent, and comprehensive model of the problem at hand. Beyond obvious signs of immediate distress, indicators include cognitive errors in describing the problem. This mostly includes being calm but jumping from topic to topic or staying on topic while providing contradictory facts.

Interestingly, the assessor might not be able to detect these indicators unless they are functioning somewhat higher on those dimensions than the patient. The assessor’s cognition must occur at a higher resolution than the patient’s cognition to detect defects in the patient’s cognition. This will require a shift in thinking for many providers and may be quite difficult to achieve. It implies that the assessor must have their own acute level of anxiety under control enough to perform an accurate assessment. One advantage that the assessor has on their side is not being as involved in the topic as the patient so they should not have the same anxious response to it.

The assessor must mentally track each thread of logic presented by the patient. They must note each jump to a new thread while evaluating whether each thread is logically coherent. The patient will often make more cognitive errors the closer they are to topics where anxiety is more involved. They may efficiently and coherently describe a low-anxiety topic like a hobby while their model of the symptom is quite difficult to follow.

## Application of Anxiety to the Case

In the case example, the patient’s error rate was quite high while describing the problem. Answers to simple factual questions would immediately go off topic without providing an answer. What answers were provided were often incomplete or contradictory. Continued questioning revealed that the patient possessed knowledge of the simple objective facts that were asked for but they were obscured by error rate in cognition. 

As one example, the patient initially reported that she was positive for UTI’s. When asked for the result of a home UTI test taken on a specific date, she answered with the medication her doctor told her to take. When pressed again for the specific result of the home test instead of what her doctor had told her, she responded saying she frequently has positive home UTI tests. Continued questioning eventually revealed the grocery store where the home tests were purchased, the color of the box, the patient confirming the test in a lineup of tests sold at the store from a google search. The assessor then downloaded the instructions for the test making it possible to ask the much more precise question of whether the test had one or two bars and which shade the test bar matched up with on the colored legend provided in the instructions. The patient revealed that the color bar in her test matched with the first of three shades in the legend. This indicated an unclear result and required a second test later that day. The patient did not read the instructions in enough detail to understand she needed to take the second test. A plan was made for her to take photos of each test result next to the rubric that came with the test. This would provide a perfectly objective answer to the question of home test results. The patient eventually learned to precisely report her results verbally without the need for photos. Finally, the conclusion was made that she has a mix of positive and negative results. The resolution for this one factor in the overall problem had increased.

Home UTI test results are only one of many facts in the case. As is apparent in the above description, it is both toilsome and time-consuming to wade through errors in a patient’s thinking to get an accurate report of a single factor. This is the character of anxiety. It impairs the cognitive system and obscures even the most basic facts so much that treatment can be widely misdirected and ineffective. However, the proposition here is that this factor must be understood and properly controlled for, or treatment may be costly, ineffective, and possibly even make the problem worse.

Luckily, this patient had an excellent memory. Her level of anxiety prevented her from hearing each question correctly, but she could provide answers that were perfectly clear when the assessor was able to ask sufficiently specific questions. This excellent memory gave the assessor motivation to devote an unusual amount of time and energy to constructing a timeline. This resulted in an exceptionally clear timeline that shows a reasonably falsifiable impact of anxiety as a latent variable on the presented problems. The timeline follows:

\[Lack of resilience began with death of grandfather the patriarch and removal of the galbladder four years prior.\]

# Discussion of the Case Example

# Treatment

Any etiological paper in Clinical Psychology must address the topic of treatment. The charge of the discipline is, after all, to correct undesirable problems of behavior. If the function of diagnosis is to determine treatment, then the topic of diagnosis must be addressed as well.

As discussed, the definition of anxiety proposed here does not represent a new diagnostic category. In fact, it muddles the idea of diagnosis up further by proposing a factor implicated in the physiological system to adapt to any challenge. How then, can we affect treatment?

The focus on anxiety as a single behavioral variable should simplify decision on what to do about it. “Treatment” isn’t quite the right word because the term is culturally loaded with fixing the one root cause of a problem. A slight shift in thinking is required to adjust the level of anxiety without removing that goal from the broader context of factors that it impacts and is impacted by.

# Discussion

The first and most apparent observation of this view is that it positions anxiety as a cornerstone concept in the study of adaptive behavior. It is not necessarily a concept of behavior in general but of adaptive behavior toward survival.

This key position implies the question in any physical or emotional dilemma, what is the impact of anxiety in this problem? It merely proposes one of many factors to be ruled out. It is a factor that must be considered when no easy solution or diagnosis appears for physical problems, or when solvable problems repeatedly occur. A new definition of anxiety can provide a new range of longer-term solutions to such difficult problems while resolving some common polarities in current thinking.
