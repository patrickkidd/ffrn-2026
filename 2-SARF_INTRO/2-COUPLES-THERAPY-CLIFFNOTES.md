# SARF in 25 Minutes: Couples Therapy Grad Students

**Audience:** Graduate students, no clinical training yet, non-technical
**Duration:** Under 30 minutes (leaves 5 min for questions)

## HOOK: A Case (1 min)

Mother brings daughter in. "She bites her nails. It's always been there."

The nursing trainees want to treat the pain—bandage the fingers, maybe anxiety meds.

I asked one question: *"When did it start?"*

Mother: "Well... it was when her boyfriend left."

Two sessions later, the symptom was gone. Mother forgot it ever existed.

*How? I'll come back to this.*

## WHY SCIENTIFIC THINKING MATTERS (5 min)

### The Field Has a Problem

- Treatment for depression increased **4x** from 1987-2007 (Ormel et al., 2022)
- Depression rates: **stayed the same or went up** (Ormel et al., 2022)
- Teen depression up **145%** since 2010 (CDC, 2023)
- Teen suicide up **62%** (2007-2021) (CDC, 2023; JED Foundation)
- More therapists, more spending, more awareness than ever

*More treatment is not producing less suffering.*

### Without Measurement, Bad Ideas Spread

When you can't test whether something works, what determines which ideas win?

- Who's loudest
- What feels right
- What's socially safe to say

Historical examples (all driven by caring professionals):
- **Lobotomies:** 50,000 surgeries. Patients seemed "calmer." (Caruso & Sheehan, 2017)
- **Recovered memory therapy:** ~1 million patients convinced of false memories. Families destroyed. (EBSCO Research)
- **Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study:** Mentorship program for at-risk boys. 30-year follow-up: treatment group had more crime, more alcoholism, earlier death. (McCord, 1978)

*Caring isn't enough. Without measurement, caring can hurt.*

### Your Guiding Question

Every intervention you do, ask yourself:

***"How would I know if I'm making this worse?"***

## THE SARF MODEL: Four Variables (7 min)

### What Makes This Different

**1. The problem might not be "in" the person.**
Standard approach: something's wrong with the patient, find it, fix it. SARF asks: what's happening in their relationships? The daughter wasn't the problem—the mother's anxiety was.

**2. Relationships affect anxiety, anxiety affects symptoms.**
Before you treat the symptom directly, ask: is something in their relationships driving this? Is their anxiety spiking because of what's happening with the people around them?

**3. Anxiety isn't a feeling—it's what happens when you don't know what to do and it feels urgent.**
When people feel uncertain and pressured, they grab for anything that makes the uncertainty go away. This explains a lot of the "irrational" behavior you'll see in clients.

**4. The goal isn't to make symptoms disappear—it's to help people function better.**
If someone can think more clearly and manage themselves better in their relationships, the symptoms often take care of themselves. You saw it in the nail-biting case: we never treated the nails.

**5. We're admitting we don't fully understand this stuff yet.**
A lot of the field acts like the answers are known and we just need better delivery. SARF says: let's track a few simple things, see what patterns emerge, and learn. That humility is what makes it scientific.

**The short version:** Instead of asking "what's wrong with this person?", ask "what's happening in their relationships, and how is that showing up as symptoms?"

### The Variables

**S – A – R – F** (Symptom, Anxiety, Relationship, Functioning)

**The pipeline:** R → A → S
- **Relationship shifts** drive **Anxiety** which drives **Symptoms**
- **Functioning** is your lever—raise F to buffer the impact

### S: Symptom

Whatever brings them in. Mental health, behavioral, emotional, physical.

- Track: up, down, same

### A: Anxiety

**Not** "feeling stressed." **Anxiety = perceived uncertainty + urgency.**

- When anxious, people search for *anything* to reduce uncertainty
- Thinking gets worse as anxiety goes up—they jump around, contradict themselves, can't answer simple questions
- Track: up, down, same

### R: Relationship

The *automatic* moves people make toward/away from each other:

- **Conflict** – fighting, overt tension
- **Distance** – withdrawal, avoidance
- **Over/under-functioning** – one does more, one does less
- **Child-focus** – anxiety channeled into worry about a kid
- **Cutoff** – severing contact
- **Triangle** – pulling in a third party to stabilize

And the sophisticated option:

- **Define self** – taking a position while staying connected (requires higher F)

### F: Functioning

How well someone balances emotion and thinking toward their goals.

- Low F: ruled by emotion, can't plan, can't see forest for trees
- High F: can pause, think long-term, update their approach
- **Clinical goal: "function up"**

## BACK TO THE CASE: SARF Applied (5 min)

**Presenting complaint:** Daughter bites nails. "Always been there."

| Variable | What I Found |
|----------|--------------|
| **S** (Symptom) | Nail-biting in daughter |
| **R** (Relationship) | Boyfriend fled → Mother's relationship system destabilized |
| **A** (Anxiety) | Mother's anxiety spiked (uncertainty + urgency) |
| **S** (Symptom) | Daughter's nail-biting *started* at the same time |

**The RN trainees' implicit model:** Problem is in the daughter. Locate it. Fix it.

**The SARF model:** R → A → S. The mother's relationship shift drove her anxiety, which showed up as symptoms in the daughter.

**Intervention:** Work on mother's **F** (functioning). Help her manage her own anxiety in relationships rather than channeling it into worry about her daughter.

**Outcome:** Two sessions. Symptom remission. Mother forgot it existed.

**The blade of grass:** The daughter's nail-biting was like a blade of grass bending in the wind. You can measure the grass all day—angle, position, structure—and still not predict when it moves. Because the grass isn't the phenomenon. *The wind is.* The wind was in the mother's relationship system.

---

## CLOSE (2 min)

**Before your next intake:** Ask when the symptom started. Ask what was happening in relationships at that time.

**The question that changes everything:** *"How would I know if I'm making this worse?"*

---

## BONUS: Couples Example (if time permits)

**Presenting complaint:** Wife says husband is a workaholic. "He's always been like this. He doesn't prioritize me."

**Trainees' model:** Husband has a problem (avoidant attachment? narcissism? poor boundaries with work?). Fix him.

**Timeline question:** *"When did it get worse?"*

Wife: "Well... it really ramped up after my mom moved in with us."

---

**SARF Breakdown:**

| Variable | What Happened |
|----------|---------------|
| **R** (Relationship) | Mother-in-law moved in → Wife triangled with her mother, emotional energy shifted away from husband |
| **A** (Anxiety) | Husband's anxiety spiked (uncertainty about his place in the marriage, urgency to "do something") |
| **S** (Symptom) | Husband's overworking increased—distance as an automatic move to manage anxiety |

**The pattern:** Wife pulls toward mother → Husband feels outside the triangle → Anxiety rises → He distances into work → Wife complains he's distant → He works more.

**Intervention:** Work on wife's **F**. Help her define herself in relation to *both* her mother and her husband rather than merging with one and distancing from the other. As her functioning goes up, the triangle calms, husband's anxiety drops, the "workaholism" decreases.

**The blade of grass:** The husband's overworking looks like his problem. But it's tracking the triangle. The wind is in the relationship system—specifically, how anxiety moves through the wife-husband-mother triangle.

**Why this matters for you:** You're going to see a lot of "my partner does X" complaints. The symptom-bearer isn't always where the work needs to happen.
