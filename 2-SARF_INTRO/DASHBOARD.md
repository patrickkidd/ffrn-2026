# Presentation 2: Introduction to SARF

**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025**
**Duration TBD**

## Status

**Current state:** First draft outline complete (`1-OUTLINE-DRAFT.md`). Needs review, case examples, timing.

## Todo

- [ ] Determine presentation duration
- [ ] Add concrete case example(s) for non-technical audience
- [ ] Decide on app promo placement (distributed vs. end)
- [ ] Review "A" section length—may be too long
- [ ] Decide Bowen terminology usage (triangle, differentiation)
- [ ] Create slides

## Priorities

1. Case example (makes abstract concrete)
2. Duration/timing
3. "A" section scope decision

## Purpose

Introduce the SARF data model as a minimal, testable framework for collecting data on the relationship-symptom connection. This follows "Why Family?" which established the scientific problems.

## Core Message

SARF (Symptom, Anxiety, Relationship, Functioning) is the minimum framework needed to start collecting data on how relationships impact symptoms. The etiological pipeline is R → A → S, with F as the independent clinical variable.

## Key Concepts

| Variable | Definition | Value Space |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **S** (Symptom) | Problems that bring people in | up, down, same |
| **A** (Anxiety) | Autonomic threat response to perceived uncertainty + urgency | up, down, same |
| **R** (Relationship) | Automatic moves toward/away from others | conflict, distance, reciprocal, child-focus, cutoff, triangle (in/out), define-self |
| **F** (Functioning) | Balance of emotion/thinking toward goals | up, down, same |

## Key Sources

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `../resources/SARF-White-Paper.md` | Authoritative SARF definition (Stinson, 2025) |
| `../resources/Anxiety-as-a-Core-Concept-in-Human-and-Animal-Behavior.md` | Deep dive on the "A" variable |

## Outline Snapshots

| File | Status |

## Audience Considerations

- Non-technical (no STEM background)
- Bowen tradition context, but avoid relying on Bowen authority
- International: translated to Spanish/Portuguese
- Needs concrete examples, not just abstract theory

## Open Questions

- How much case example material to include?
- Balance between "A" depth and overall presentation flow
- When to mention apps (distributed vs. concentrated)
- Is R → A → S too abstract? Need case examples?
- How much Bowen terminology to use/avoid? (triangle, differentiation)

## Tools to Promote

- Family Diagram "Pro" app (released)
- "Personal" AI intake app (in development)
- IRR study web app (R&D)

## Included Concepts

- SARF acronym and pipeline (R → A → S, F as lever)
- RDoC parallel (NIH minimum framework)
- Anxiety = perceived uncertainty + urgency
- Anxiety as search path (stops when solution found)
- Function vs. error in anxiety
- Band-aid analogy
- "As anxiety up, complex thinking down"
- Relationship shift categories (conflict, distance, reciprocal, child-focus, cutoff, triangle, define-self)
- "Automatic" = evolutionarily older behavioral model
- Define-self = activating PFC to inhibit automatic response
- Timeline method for data collection
- Differential diagnosis framing (rule out A and R)

## Bookmarked Concepts (Not Yet Included)

- UTI case example from anxiety paper (detailed clinical example)
- Markovian decision model (may be too technical)
- Positive/negative emotion valence
- Latent variable concept (anxiety not directly measurable)
