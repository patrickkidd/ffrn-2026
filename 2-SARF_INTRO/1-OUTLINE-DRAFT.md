# Introduction to SARF: Outline Draft 1

**Presentation 2 of Day**
**Duration**: TBD
**Presenter**: Dr. Patrick Stinson

## Context

This presentation follows the "Why Family?" presentation that laid out the scientific problems in behavioral health. The audience is now primed to understand *why* we need a new framework. This presentation introduces *what* that framework is.

## I. Opening: The Problem of Measurement

**Hook**: You can't coordinate without common measurement.

- The dollar analogy: Everyone knows what a dollar is. Every dollar is the same. This enables global markets. Without common currency, you only have barter—one person's valuation against another's.
- Current behavioral health: We have barter. My diagnosis vs. your diagnosis. My theory vs. your theory.
- Facts depolarize. Clear concepts allow people to *agree* and then move forward together.

**Transition**: So what would a "common currency" for understanding symptoms look like?

## II. SARF Overview: The Minimum Testable Framework

**What SARF is**:
- **S**ymptom, **A**nxiety, **R**elationship, **F**unctioning
- A qualitative, timeseries data model
- The *minimum* categories needed to collect data and test hypotheses
- Not comprehensive—intentionally minimal so we can start collecting data and *learn*

**The etiological pipeline**: R → A → S
- Relationship shifts modulate Anxiety
- Anxiety modulates Symptoms
- Functioning (F) is the independent variable—higher F means less impact of R and A on S

**What SARF is NOT**:
- Not claiming *all* symptoms work this way
- Not a replacement for medical diagnosis
- Not a complete theory—it's a starting point for research

**Analogy to RDoC**:
- NIH announced RDoC two weeks before DSM-5 (2013)
- Cancelled all DSM-only research funding
- Reason: DSM has low scientific validity
- RDoC = minimum framework for testable hypotheses
- SARF = minimum framework for relationship-symptom research

## III. Deep Dive: The "A" Variable (Anxiety)

### What Anxiety Is (in SARF)

Anxiety = **perceived uncertainty + urgency**

- NOT "feeling bad" or "distress"
- NOT a psychiatric diagnosis
- IS the autonomic threat response
- IS deeply biological, evolutionarily ancient
- IS determined by *perception* (not objective reality)

### How Anxiety Works

When anxiety rises, the first thing people do is **search for a way to reduce uncertainty**.

The anxious response is a **search path**:
1. Something creates perceived uncertainty + urgency
2. Energy mobilizes, attention narrows
3. The system searches for *anything* that reduces uncertainty
4. When a "solution" is found (real or perceived), anxiety drops
5. The search stops—whether the problem is actually solved or not

### Function vs. Error

**Critical point**: Anxiety has a *function*. It's not all bad.

- Function: Mobilize energy for decisive action, reduce uncertainty
- Error: The side effects that don't achieve the function

Examples of error:
- Energy diverted to unrelated targets (drinking, gossip, symptoms)
- Attention stuck on oversimplified explanations
- Cognitive errors increase (can't think straight)
- Physical systems affected (HPA axis, inflammation, etc.)

### The Band-Aid Analogy

Two responses to a cut knee:
1. Calmly apply a band-aid
2. Run into house screaming, break furniture, distress spouse who leaves stove on, house burns down, family homeless

The anxious response can create more damage than the original problem.

### Anxiety and Cognition

**As anxiety goes up, complex thinking goes down.**

Observable in clinical interviews:
- Jumping from topic to topic
- Contradictory facts
- Unable to answer simple questions directly
- Content of thinking becomes lower resolution

## IV. The "R" Variable: Relationship Shifts

**Value space**: conflict, distance, reciprocal functioning, child-focus, cutoff, inside triangle, outside triangle, defined-self

### What "Relationship Shift" Means

- **Automatic** moves a person makes toward/away from others
- "Automatic" = driven by emotion, without choice, short-term motivated
    - Determined by an evolutionarily older behavioral model
- Not what people *say* they do—what they *actually* do

### The Short-Term Strategies (Reactive)

1. **Conflict**: Fighting, arguing, overt tension
2. **Distance**: Withdrawal, avoidance, "space"
3. **Reciprocal functioning**: Over/under functioning patterns
4. **Child-focus**: Anxiety channeled into worry about child
5. **Cutoff**: Severing contact, pretending person doesn't exist
6. **Triangling**: Pulling in third party to stabilize dyad

### The Long-Term Strategy (Innovative)

**Define self**: The sophisticated response
- Taking a position based on one's own thinking
    - Activating the Pre-Frontal Cortex which inhibits automatic response
- Staying connected while differentiated
- Requires functioning (F) to execute

---

## V. The "S" Variable: Symptoms

**Value space**: up, down, same

### What Counts as a Symptom

- Mental/behavioral/emotional/psychiatric diagnoses
- Chronic medical issues (autoimmune, allergies, cancers, etc.)
- Anything that brings someone to a clinician

### The Hypothesis

Episodic symptoms are modulated by *acute* shifts in anxiety.
Durable symptom changes require shifts in *chronic* anxiety level.

---

## VI. The "F" Variable: Functioning

**Value space**: up, down, same

### What Functioning Means

- How well balanced emotion and thinking are toward the person's goals
- Goals defined when the person is at their *calmest*
- Low functioning: ruled by emotion, unable to plan, can't see forest for trees
- High functioning: can inhibit impulse, consider long-term, update mental models

### F as the Clinical Lever

- F is the independent variable
- Higher F → less impact of R and A on S
- Clinical goal: "function up"
- All the usual therapeutic work goes here

---

## VII. Application: The Timeline Method

### Collecting the Data

1. Gather timeline of **nodal events** (relationship shifts, anxiety shifts, symptom shifts)
2. Plot them on a timeline
3. Look for correlations between R, A, and S
4. Rule out A and R as impacting S (differential diagnosis)

### What Good Data Looks Like

- Factual observations, not interpretations
- Specific dates and events
- Shifts marked as up/down/same
- Relationship patterns categorized by type

### The Challenge

- Anxiety impairs the very cognition needed to report accurately
- Patients often can't answer simple questions directly
- Requires skilled interviewing to tease out facts from anxious distortions

## VIII. Tools and Future Directions

### Family Diagram "Pro" App

- SARF variables built in
- Visualize shifts on the family diagram over time
- Already released

### "Personal" AI Intake App (In Development)

- AI chatbot generates timeline and family diagram through conversation
- Makes data collection accessible to anyone
- Creates case file that "Pro" app can open
- Intake tool for clinicians

### R&D: Inter-Rater Reliability Study

- Web app for blind SARF coding of cases
- Testing whether domain experts agree on coding
- If sufficient IRR achieved → train AI model to auto-code

---

## IX. Closing: What This Makes Possible

**Return to the measurement theme**:
- SARF gives us common variables to track
- Common variables enable coordination
- Coordination enables real research
- Real research could finally test the hypothesis that relationships impact symptoms

**The invitation**:
- You can start using this today
- Collect timelines in your cases
- Look for the R → A → S pattern
- Contribute to a data-driven future for family systems work

## Open Questions / Weak Points

1. **Abstraction level**: Is R → A → S too abstract for this audience? Need concrete case examples?
2. **The "A" section is long**: Maybe this deserves its own presentation? Or is this the right level of depth?
3. **Tools promo timing**: When to mention apps—woven throughout or concentrated at end?
4. **Bowen terminology**: How much to use/avoid? "Triangle" is Bowen-specific. "Differentiation" too.
5. **Case example needed?**: The anxiety paper has the UTI case—include a simplified version?
