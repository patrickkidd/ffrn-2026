## Core Thesis

**The One Sentence:** "The problem isn't inside your client."

**The Enemy:** The assumption that the problem lives inside the individual.

**The Smallest Viable Win:** "Before your next intake, draw the family."

## Outline

### I. OPENING: The Engineer's Confession (5 min)

- Your story: engineer enters behavioral health field
- Expected: if it doesn't work, fix it or discard it
- Found: something else entirely
- *"I'm not here to attack anyone's training. I'm here to share what I've learned trying to make sense of a field that confused me."*

**Transition:** *"Let me show you what confused me."*

---

### II. FOUR UNCOMFORTABLE FACTS (10 min)

Present without editorializing. Let them land.

1. **The Treatment-Prevalence Paradox**
   - Treatment for depression increased **4x** from 1987-2007
   - Prevalence of depression: **stayed the same or increased**
   - *"More treatment does not mean less depression."*

2. **The Relapse Problem**
   - After first depression episode: 50% relapse
   - After second: 70% relapse. After third: **90% relapse**
   - 85% recurrence within a decade
   - *"The fire keeps getting relit."*

3. **The Youth Crisis**
   - Teen depression up **145%** (2010-2021)
   - Suicide deaths ages 10-24: up **62%** (2007-2021)
   - 1 in 5 high school students seriously considered suicide in 2023
   - More therapists, more spending, more awareness than ever
   - *"It's not working. Not even close."*

4. **The Institutional Collapse**
   - ~40% of psychology studies replicate
   - NIMH stopped funding DSM-only research (2013)
   - *"The largest funder of mental health research lost confidence in our diagnostic system."*

**Transition:** *"I spent years asking: why? What's the blind spot?"*

---

### III. THE BLADE OF GRASS (15 min)

**The Metaphor:**
- Studying a blade of grass to understand why it bends
- Measuring angle, cellular structure, position
- Still can't predict movement
- Because the grass isn't the phenomenon. The wind is.
- *"We've spent 80 years studying blades of grass."*

**Connect to Their Experience:**
- "Client improves in session, falls apart at home"
- "Discharge a patient, see them again in 6 months" (85% within a decade)
- "Symptoms treated, but the fire keeps getting relit" (50/70/90% relapse rates)
- The implicit model: "The way you understand a problem determines what you do to solve it."
- *"You're not failing. You're solving the wrong problem."*

**The Core Claim:**
- *"The problem isn't inside your client."*
- The individual is the wrong unit of analysis
- Behavior that looks chaotic at the individual level shows patterns at the system level

**Transition:** *"This isn't just philosophy. There's evidence."*

---

### IV. THE EVIDENCE FOR THE WIND (10 min)

**The Finnish Study (2024):**
- 700,000 ninth-graders tracked over years
- Having classmates with mental disorders → 9-18% increased risk for you
- Strongest for mood, anxiety, eating disorders
- *"Mental disorders spread through social networks."*

**What This Means:**
- Not what you'd expect if the problem were inside individuals
- Exactly what you'd expect if the problem were in systems
- The "wind" is measurable. We just haven't been measuring it.

**Transition:** *"So what do we do about this?"*

---

### V. WHY FAMILY? (10 min)

**The Right Level of Analysis:**
- Family is the smallest system where the wind is visible
- Not society (too big, too abstract), not the individual (too small, misses the pattern)
- One level up from the blade of grass
- Bowen saw this 60 years ago; now we have tools to measure it

**Tease What's Coming:**
- *"After the break, I'll show you a simplified model—SARF—for thinking about this systematically."*
- *"This afternoon, I'll show you a tool that lets you capture and visualize what you're about to learn to see."*
- *"And we'll look at what becomes possible when we can finally measure emotional process over time."*

---

### VI. CLOSE (5 min)

End with the question, not the answer:

*"What if the reason we can't predict outcomes isn't that human behavior is unpredictable—but that we've been looking at the wrong level? What if the patterns are there, and we've just been too zoomed in to see them?"*

*"Let's take a break. When we come back, I'll show you the map."*

## What This Sets Up

| Presentation 1 Creates... | Later Sessions Deliver... |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| "We need a new framework" | SARF |
| "We need measurement" | AI model + App |
| "Family is the right level" | Clinical case (Havstad) |
| "This could change everything" | Data & the future |

## What's NOT in This Presentation

| Topic | Why It's Cut |
|-------|--------------|
| Paradigm terminology (positivism, etc.) | Too academic |
| Popper/Kuhn/falsification | Audience doesn't need it |
| Big Five / therapist personality | Risks alienating the room |
| Deep measurability argument | Save for SARF session |
| Detailed methodology critique | Dissertation is backup |
| RDoC details | Tangent for this audience |
| Polarization thread | Too abstract |
| SARF details | That's the next presentation |
| App demo | That's the afternoon |
