## I. OPENING: The Engineer's Confession (3 min)

- Your story: engineer enters behavioral health field
- Expected: if it doesn't work, fix it or discard it
- Found: something else entirely
- *"I'm not here to attack anyone's training. I'm here to share what I've learned trying to make sense of a field that confused me."*

**Transition:** *"Let me show you what confused me."*

---

## II. THE FIELD IS BROKEN: Four Uncomfortable Facts (12 min)

Present without editorializing. Let them land.

### 1. The Treatment-Prevalence Paradox (CENTERPIECE)

- Treatment for depression **increased 4x** from 1987-2007
- Prevalence of depression: **stayed the same or increased**
- *"More treatment does not mean less depression."*

Source: [Ormel et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735821001549)

### 2. The Relapse Problem

- After first episode: **50% relapse**
- After second: **70%**. After third: **90%**
- 85% recurrence within a decade
- *"The fire keeps getting relit."*

### 3. The Youth Crisis

- Teen depression: **145% increase** (2010-2021)
- Suicide deaths ages 10-24: **62% increase** (2007-2021)
- 1 in 5 high school students seriously considered suicide in 2023
- More therapists, more spending, more awareness than ever
- *"It's not working. Not even close."*

### 4. The Institutional Collapse (brief)

- ~40% of psychology studies replicate
- NIMH stopped funding DSM-only research (2013)
- *"The largest funder of mental health research lost confidence in our diagnostic system."*

**Transition:** *"This isn't new. Let me show you the pattern."*

---

## III. WHY IT'S NOT WORKING: Historical Patterns (12 min)

### A. Helping Can Hurt: Cambridge-Somerville (6 min)

**The Setup:**
- 506 boys, matched pairs, random assignment
- Treatment group got: counseling, mentorship, summer camp, medical care
- Intention: prevent delinquency through caring intervention

**The Result (30-year follow-up):**
Treatment group did **WORSE**:
- More crime, more alcoholism, more mental illness
- Lower job satisfaction, more stress disorders
- **Earlier death**

Joan McCord: *"No one had ever discussed the possibility that intervention... has any potential for harmful effects."*

**Also:** Scared Straight (kids did worse), DARE (no effect on drug use)

*"Well-intentioned helping, informed by intuition rather than measurement, can make things worse."*

### B. Mental Phenomena Spread (4 min)

**Historical:** Dancing Plague 1518, Salem 1692, Convent hysterias, June Bug Epidemic 1962

**Modern:** TikTok Tics (2021)—first documented "mass social media-induced illness." Tourette's-like symptoms spread through adolescent girls after a YouTube channel went viral.

**Finnish Study (2024):**
- 700,000 ninth-graders tracked
- Classmates with mental disorders → **9-18% increased risk** for you
- *"Mental disorders spread through social networks."*

### C. Concepts Drift (2 min)

- Fads: Hysteria → MPD → ADHD → "Trauma"
- Current problem: everyone uses "trauma," nobody can measure it
- *"Without measurable definitions, concepts drift. Drift creates confusion. Confusion prevents coordination."*

**Transition:** *"So what's the blind spot?"*

---

## IV. THE BLADE OF GRASS (8 min)

### The Metaphor

- Studying a blade of grass to understand why it bends
- Measuring angle, cellular structure, position
- Still can't predict movement
- Because the grass isn't the phenomenon. **The wind is.**
- *"We've spent 80 years studying blades of grass."*

### Connect to Their Experience

- "Client improves in session, falls apart at home"
- "Discharge a patient, see them again in 6 months" (85% relapse)
- "Symptoms treated, but the fire keeps getting relit" (50/70/90%)
- *"You're not failing. You're solving the wrong problem."*

### The Core Claim

- *"The problem isn't inside your client."*
- The individual is the wrong unit of analysis
- Behavior that looks chaotic at the individual level shows **patterns at the system level**

### The Implicit Model

- *"The way you understand a problem determines what you do to solve it."*
- Current implicit model: problem is inside the individual
- This determines everything: treatment, research, funding, training

**Transition:** *"So what do we do about this?"*

---

## V. THE PROPOSAL: Shift the Unit of Analysis (10 min)

### Why Family? (Not Society, Not Individual)

- Family is the smallest system where the wind is visible
- Not society (too big, too abstract)
- Not the individual (too small, misses the pattern)
- One level up from the blade of grass

### Why Measurability Matters

**The Common Currency Argument:**
- Everyone knows what a dollar is → global markets possible
- Without common currency → barter → no coordination at scale

**Facts Calm People Down:**
- First move in family therapy with misaligned perspectives: gather facts
- What is a fact? Something everyone can easily agree on
- Facts establish a depolarized baseline
- Without facts: opinion vs. opinion → tribal hierarchy → emotionally determined outcomes

### What You'll Get Today

- **Next session (SARF):** The concepts that describe what you see at the family level
- **After lunch:** Tools to capture and measure what we're learning to see
- **Clinical case:** Proof it works in practice

---

## VI. CLOSE + TRANSITION (5 min)

### The Question

*"What if the reason we can't predict outcomes isn't that human behavior is unpredictable—but that we've been looking at the wrong level? What if the patterns are there, and we've just been too zoomed in to see them?"*

### The Call to Action

*"Before your next intake, draw the family."*

### What's Coming

| Session | What You'll Get |
|---------|-----------------|
| SARF | The map—six concepts that describe family-level patterns |
| AI Tools | Technology to capture what we're learning to see |
| App Demo | Practical tools you can use Monday |
| Clinical Case | Proof it works |

---

## VII. Q&A / CLARIFYING QUESTIONS (10 min)

Reserve for audience questions. Likely topics:
- "Are you saying therapy doesn't work?"
- "What about individual factors like genetics?"
- "How does this change what I do Monday?"

---

## WHAT GOT CUT (Saved for Later Sessions)

| Topic | Where It Goes |
|-------|---------------|
| Six Bowen concepts (detailed) | SARF session—they're the "R" |
| Female temperament argument | Too tangential for time |
| Attachment study | Need citation; save for later |
| Detailed concept creep | Mentioned briefly |
| Two types of mass hysteria | Background only |
