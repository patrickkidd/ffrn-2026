# SECTION 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW

## What This Is
One-day Zoom conference by Florida Family Research Network (FFRN). Patrick Stinson presenting on his work as software engineer, psychologist, and R&D expert in Bowen Theory + AI. First presentation of the day sets up the scientific problems in behavioral health field.

## Presenter Profile
- **Name**: Dr. Patrick Stinson
- **Background**: Software engineer + psychologist, R&D in Bowen Theory, AI applications
- **Organization**: Alaska Family Systems (alaskafamilysystems.com)
- **Key Work**: SARF data model, Family Diagram "Pro" app, upcoming "Personal" AI intake app
- **Dissertation**: Stinson (2020) - lit review on problems in psychological science

## Audience Profile
- Family therapists, graduate students, trainees
- Non-technical (no STEM background, likely selected *against* quantitative temperament)
- Bowen tradition context (FFRN)
- International: translated to Spanish/Portuguese for Latin American countries
- Prone to apathy when confronted with systemic problems they can't solve

## Goals
1. Lay out scientific problems in behavioral health field
2. Argue for shift from individual to family as unit of analysis
3. Introduce SARF as minimal testable framework
4. Inspire audience toward scientific/critical thinking without inducing apathy
5. Soft promotion of apps and AI intake tool
6. Establish thought leadership on role of family in individual functioning

## Emotional/Thematic Frame
"Hobbit/LOTR Shire opening" - everything seems nice, why would we leave, but there are world-ending problems and our lives may not be as nice as they seem. Invite audience on adventure. **Do not name this explicitly** - let the feeling land.

# SECTION 2: RHETORICAL CONSTRAINTS

## Do NOT:
1. Invoke Bowen as authority (creates in-group box, stagnation, alienates younger generation)
2. Get polarizing (APA guidance on boys/men, gender politics, liberal/conservative splits, "charlatans")
3. Be condescending about complacency (don't lecture)
4. Use US-specific idioms (translation issues)
5. Overcomplicate (presenter's self-identified tendency)

## DO:
1. Emphasize critical thinking as paramount
2. Acknowledge counter-arguments honestly
3. Make it feel like invitation to adventure
4. Present facts without moralizing
5. Model intellectual honesty about epistemic status of claims

# SECTION 3: CORE THESIS STRUCTURE

## Three Moves:

### Move 1: The field is in scientific trouble
- Replication crisis
- NIMH abandoning DSM (2013, ongoing)
- Social contagion as symptom of diagnostic invalidity
- Allegiance bias, low study quality

### Move 2: Shift unit of analysis from individual to family
- Not because Bowen said so
- Because patterns chaotic at individual level become interpretable at system level
- Weather → climate analogy

### Move 3: SARF as minimal, testable framework
- Designed to be falsifiable, data-driven, scalable
- In spirit of RDoC
- Something any practitioner can start doing now

---

# SECTION 4: EVIDENCE BASE (UPDATED SOURCES)

## Replication Crisis

### Bogdan (2025) - AMPPS
- Analyzed 240,000 psychology papers (2004-2024)
- Every subdiscipline trending toward stronger p-values (some improvement)
- But still problematic overall

### Northwestern/Uzzi AI Model (2023)
- Applied ML to 40,000+ articles in top psychology journals
- ~40% of studies likely to replicate

### Cuijpers et al. - Psychotherapy Quality
- High-quality studies: effect size d = 0.22
- Low-quality studies: effect size d = 0.74
- Quality predicts effect size (each point increase in quality reduces effect by -0.07)

### Reporting Bias
- 19% of meta-analyses with initially significant results became non-significant after adjustment

### Allegiance Bias
- Outcome studies biased toward authors' psychotherapeutic allegiance
- Industry funding skews results toward funder's interests

## NIMH/DSM

### 2013 NIMH Announcement
- Withdrew funding for research based exclusively on DSM
- Announced RDoC as alternative framework
- Quote (Insel): DSM diagnoses "based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure"

### Hyman (2010) Quote
- DSM created "an unintended epistemic prison that was palpably impeding scientific progress"

### February 2025 JAMA Network Open
- Used LLMs to track NIMH grant funding patterns
- Shift away from DSM-based research continues

### RDoC Critique
- Atheoretical, reductionist
- Ignores emergent properties
- May not solve the fundamental problem

## Social Contagion

### May 2024 JAMA Psychiatry (Finnish data)
- Association between peer diagnosis in adolescence and increased risk of later diagnosis
- Caveat: confounders (shared environment, neighborhood effects)

### TikTok/Social Media Self-Diagnosis
- Most common inaccurate self-diagnoses: DID, bipolar, autism, ADHD
- One review: 84% of TikTok mental health advice videos inaccurate
- Adolescent females most likely to present with self-diagnosis

### Contagion Research Caveats
- Confounders are persistent problem
- May be awareness/help-seeking contagion rather than disorder contagion
- Present honestly

## DSM Validity Problems (from Stinson 2020)

### From DSM-5 Introduction
- "Boundaries between many disorder 'categories' are more fluid over the life course than DSM-IV recognized"
- "Many symptoms assigned to a single disorder may occur, at varying levels of severity, in many other disorders"
- "Boundaries between disorders are more porous than originally perceived"

### Critique
- Methodology "only speaks to the development of reliable opinions, not whether those opinions are correct"
- Cannot claim to represent objective empirical data derived from nature
- Far from generating reliable differential diagnoses

---

# SECTION 5: KEY ANALOGIES

## Weather vs. Climate (PRIMARY ANALOGY)

### The Mapping
- **Weather**: Chaotic, unpredictable beyond ~10 days, sensitive to initial conditions → Individual symptoms/behavior in isolation
- **Climate**: Patterned, projectable over decades → Family/relationship patterns

### Key Phrases
- "Weather is what you get. Climate is what you expect."
- Boiling water: "A weather forecast would try to predict the exact location of each bubble rising to the surface. A climate projection would estimate how the overall temperature of the pan changes over time, based on the heat source."

### Lorenz Story (from Stinson 2020)
- 1950s weather prediction attempts
- Variables could account for past data but not predict future
- Small changes in inputs → erratic changes in outputs over time
- Discovery: "Islands of coherence amidst turbulence"
- Ordered disorder at higher levels of analysis and longer time periods

### Epistemological Point
- Level of analysis determines what's predictable
- Individual = weather (chaotic)
- Family/system = climate (patterned)

## Other Candidate Analogies
- Trying to understand ocean currents by watching a single drop of water
- Murmuration (flock of starlings) vs. tracking one bird
- Blade of grass with no concept of wind
- Forest for the trees

# SECTION 6: SARF FRAMEWORK

## What It Is
Qualitative, timeseries data model for clinical evaluation and research. Minimal testable method for collecting data on relationship-symptom correlations.

## Acronym
- **S**: Symptom
- **A**: Anxiety
- **R**: Relationship
- **F**: Functioning

## Etiological Pipeline
R → A → S

## Independent Clinical Variable
F (Functioning) - higher functioning lessens impact of A and R on S

## Value Spaces
- **S**: up, down, same
- **A**: up, down, same (synonymous with autonomic threat response)
- **R**: conflict, distance, reciprocal functioning, child-focus, cutoff, inside triangle, outside triangle, defined-self
- **F**: up, down, same

## Clinical Application
1. Collect timeline of shifts in each variable (assessment interview)
2. Evaluate for correlations between variables with S
3. Use in differential diagnosis to rule out A and R impact on S

## Design Principles
- 100% data-driven
- Increase in detail/precision as evidence permits
- Falsifiable
- Parallel to RDoC: minimal framework to organize testable hypotheses

## Origin
- Havstad & Sheffield (2018): "Framework for Clinical Research based on Bowen theory"
- Stinson shortened and operationalized to SARF

## Tools (for soft promotion)
- **Family Diagram "Pro" app**: Visualize SARF shifts on family diagram over time (already released)
- **"Personal" mobile app** (in development): AI-assisted intake generates timeline and family diagram through conversation
- **IRR study underway**: Web-based app for blind domain-expert SARF coding
- **Future AI model**: Train on IRR data to automatically code interviews

## For Non-Technical Audience, Simplify To:
1. Collect a timeline of nodal events
2. Note relationship shifts
3. Note anxiety shifts  
4. Note symptom shifts
5. Look for correlations in time
6. If patterns emerge, you've got something. If they don't, you've learned something.

# SECTION 7: KEY TENSIONS TO NAVIGATE

## Tension 1: "Field needs science" vs. "I don't have hard experimental data"

### The Problem
Core proposition (symptoms more predictable at family level) derived from Bowen's clinical observations and Stinson's clinical work—not controlled studies.

### Resolution
- Be explicit about epistemic status
- Frame as hypothesis, not proven fact
- Use RDoC parallel: launched not because NIMH had answers, but because DSM was blocking progress
- "Here's what I observe clinically; here's the minimum framework that would let us test it; here's why I think it's worth testing."

## Tension 2: The Bowen Problem

### The Problem
- Audience is FFRN (Bowen people)
- SARF explicitly derived from Bowen
- R variable uses pure Bowen vocabulary
- But presenter wants to transcend in-group thinking

### Resolution
- Can't hide origin—acknowledge it
- Then pivot: "This framework comes from Bowen's clinical observations. But Bowen isn't why you should take it seriously. What matters is whether it's *testable* and whether the data support it."
- Frame Bowen as hypothesis-generator, not authority: "Bowen gave us conjectures. Conjectures are only valuable if tested. We've been coasting for 50 years. Time to test them."

## Tension 3: Depolarizing While Holding Strong Views

### Stinson's Actual Views (not for presentation)
- Field attracts non-engineers; Big 5 would predict this
- Field captured by charlatans who thrive on status vs. valid improvement
- APA guidance on boys/men departed from science, imposed feminine traits
- Therapists overwhelmingly liberal, feminine temperament
- Field is over-accommodating, passive aggressive
- Allergy toward science, "whole person" language avoids critique

### Resolution
- Stay upstream of these diagnoses
- Stick to facts: replication crisis, NIMH decision, allegiance bias, low study quality, lack of falsification culture
- These imply something is wrong without naming villains or invoking political frames

## Tension 4: Inspiring Action vs. Inducing Apathy

### The Problem
Problems are overwhelming; audience may not have training/disposition to solve them

### Resolution
- Adventure has a first step any clinician can take NOW
- "Start paying attention to relationship shifts correlated with symptom shifts in time"
- "Use SARF as minimal structure"
- "You can change what YOU do, even if you can't change the field"
- The adventure isn't "fix the entire field"—it's "change how you collect and interpret data in your own cases"

---

# SECTION 8: COUNTER-ARGUMENTS TO ADDRESS

## 1. "We treat individuals, not families"
**Response**: True. But understanding the system doesn't require treating the whole system. It changes what you're looking for and what you advise. You can work with one person while thinking systemically.

## 2. "This is just Bowen"
**Response**: Yes, the hypothesis comes from Bowen. But Bowen isn't why you should believe it. Data is why you should believe it. We don't have enough data yet. That's the problem I'm trying to solve.

## 3. "The field will never change"
**Response**: Maybe not at the institutional level. But you can change what YOU do. That's the adventure.

## 4. "Isn't this reductionist too? Substituting family for individual."
**Response**: Fair point. SARF is minimal by design—a starting point, not final answer. Goal is to build complexity/precision over time. Key difference: attending to relationships BETWEEN variables, not just variables themselves.

---

# SECTION 9: PENDING POINTS (NEED RESOLUTION)

## Point A: "Field cannot claim to fix most problems people come for"

### Possible Evidence
1. Dodo bird verdict (therapies produce equivalent outcomes—don't know why things work)
2. Effect sizes in high-quality studies (d = 0.22 isn't zero but is small)
3. Spontaneous remission rates (therapy's added value over natural improvement?)
4. Lack of differential treatment indication (can't say patient X should get treatment Z)
5. Long-term outcomes (relapse rates high; are we fixing or suppressing?)

### Rhetorical Risk
- May trigger defensiveness ("That's not my experience")
- Therapists have helped people, seen change

### Possible Reframe
"The field cannot *reliably predict* who will benefit from what, or *demonstrate* that the specific interventions we use are responsible for the changes we observe. We see improvement, but we can't explain it or replicate it systematically."

### Open Question
Anchor to specific data, or frame as "practitioners know this but don't say it"?

## Point B: "Field implicitly accepts relationships are prima materia but doesn't know what to do with it"

### Evidence Field Implicitly Accepts This
1. Therapeutic alliance as strongest predictor of outcome (relational, not individual)
2. Attachment theory's dominance (fundamentally about relational patterns)
3. Social determinants of health (isolation, loneliness predict morbidity/mortality)
4. Family therapy exists (admission individual treatment insufficient for some problems)
5. DSM's relational blind spot (no real "relational disorder" category; V-codes not reimbursable)

### Why Field Doesn't Know What To Do With It
- Relationships hard to measure (who is unit? dyad? system?)
- Relationships hard to manipulate experimentally (can't randomize to families)
- Insurance/legal structures organized around individual
- Training organized around individual psychopathology

### Proposed Bridge Function
This becomes pivot between "field is in trouble" and "shift unit of analysis":

> "The field already knows, implicitly, that relationships matter. Therapeutic alliance predicts outcome. Attachment theory dominates developmental psychology. Social isolation predicts mortality. But we've organized our research, our diagnoses, our reimbursement, and our training around the individual. We've accepted the premise but not followed through on the implications."

### Terminology Note
"Prima materia" is alchemical term. May need unpacking for non-specialists. May not translate well. Consider simpler language.

# SECTION 10: PROPOSED PRESENTATION ARC

## 1. Opening: The Comfortable Assumption (~2 min)
"We assume that what we're doing works. We assume that the categories we use—depression, anxiety, personality disorders—map onto something real. We assume that the treatments we apply have the effects we think they have."

## 2. The Uncomfortable Facts (~8-10 min)
- Replication crisis (40% likely to replicate; quality studies show smaller effects)
- NIMH abandonment of DSM (2013, ongoing)
- Social contagion (present honestly with confounders)
- Allegiance bias
- Low study quality as norm

*Tone: Don't moralize. Lay out facts. Let them sit.*

## 3. The Implicit Knowledge (~3-4 min) [NEW SECTION]
- Field already knows relationships matter
- Therapeutic alliance, attachment theory, social determinants
- But organized everything around the individual
- Accepted premise without following through

## 4. Why This Happens: Linear Thinking and Complexity (~5 min)
- Reductionism works for engineering, fails for complexity
- Weather prediction story (Lorenz)
- "Islands of coherence amidst turbulence"
- Field trying to solve complexity problem with linear tools

## 5. The Epistemological Point: Unit of Analysis Matters (~5 min)
- Weather vs. climate analogy
- Individual symptoms = weather (chaotic in isolation)
- Family/relationship patterns = climate (interpretable at higher level)

## 7. What You Can Do (~3 min)
- Collect timeline in your own practice
- Note relationship shifts, anxiety shifts, symptom shifts
- Look for correlations
- If patterns emerge, you've got something. If not, you've learned something.

## 8. Counter-Arguments (Brief, Honest) (~3 min)
- Address main objections directly
- Model intellectual honesty

## 9. The Invitation (~2 min)

# SECTION 13: KEY QUOTES TO POTENTIALLY USE

## From Stinson (2020) Dissertation

> "Linear thinking in this way looks for a direct, linear relationship between two variables, such as gene x and disease y... This type of thinking works well for problems of engineering but fails for problems of complexity where there are sometimes uncountable variables with incomprehensibly complex relationships."

> "While precise prediction was not possible, it was eventually observed that there was some regularity in the way that the weather changed. That is, a weather system possessed a pattern of ordered disorder at higher levels of analysis and over a longer period of time."

> "If the American Psychological Association is to endorse the DSM as 'the standard classification of mental disorders,' then there is much progress to be made toward psychology as a science."

> "The world has problems, but universities have departments." (Brewer, 1999)

## From NIMH/Insel

> DSM diagnoses are "based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever."

## From Hyman (2010)

> DSM created "an unintended epistemic prison that was palpably impeding scientific progress."

## Weather/Climate

> "Weather is what you get. Climate is what you expect."
