# Presentation 1: Why Family?

**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025 | 9:00-10:00 AM**
**60 minutes (including Q&A)**

## Status

**Current state:** Outline complete (`9-Claude-Outline.md`), ready for rehearsal/review.

## Todo

- [ ] Find attachment theory citation (children present as disorganized when parents fight)
- [ ] Review timing with dry run
- [ ] Finalize slides (18 minimal slides outlined)

## Priorities

1. Attachment citation (supports "wind" metaphor)
2. Dry run for timing
3. Slide deck

## Purpose

Lay out the scientific problems in behavioral health. Set up the audience to understand *why* we need a new framework before introducing SARF in Presentation 2.

## Core Message

The behavioral health field is broken—more treatment has not reduced prevalence. Historical catastrophes show the pattern: without measurable concepts, caring professions adopt untestable ideologies that spread through social contagion and cause harm. Scientific thinking + shifting the unit of analysis to family is the antidote.

## Key Theses

1. **Measurability enables coordination and defuses polarization** (common currency analogy)
2. **The implicit model determines action** (individual → treatment approach)
3. **Shift unit of analysis: individual → family** (not society)
4. **Anxiety = perceived uncertainty + urgency** (core concept for the day)

## Open Questions

- Attachment theory citation still missing (children present as disorganized when parents fight)
- Balance between data dump and emotional engagement

## Decisions Made

- Scope framed around clinical psychology as "lowest common denominator" across helping professions
- Historical catastrophes included: Salem, Lobotomy, Refrigerator Mother, Recovered Memory, Satanic Panic, MPD/DID
- Cambridge-Somerville as bridge to "caring isn't enough"
- Call to action: "Before your next intake, draw the family"

## Included Concepts

- Treatment-prevalence paradox (Ormel 2022)
- Relapse rates (50% → 70% → 90%)
- Youth crisis stats (145% increase teen depression)
- Replication crisis (~40% replicate)
- NIMH defunding DSM-only research (2013)
- Historical catastrophes pattern (untestable + simple = relief)
- Anxiety = perceived uncertainty + urgency
- Band-aid analogy (anxious response > original problem)
- Cambridge-Somerville (caring isn't enough)
- Blade of grass / wind metaphor
- Common currency analogy (facts depolarize)

## Bookmarked Concepts (Not Yet Included)

- Finnish study (classmates with mental disorders → 9-18% increased risk)
- Concept creep (TikTok self-diagnosis)
- Attachment theory limitation (secure → disorganized when parents fight)
