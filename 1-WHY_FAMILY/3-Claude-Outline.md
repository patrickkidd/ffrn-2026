## HARD STATISTICS: The Field Is Broken

### The Treatment-Prevalence Paradox (CENTERPIECE)

**Source:** [Ormel et al. (2022), Clinical Psychology Review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735821001549)

- Treatment for depression **increased 4x** from 1987-2007
- Prevalence of depression **stayed the same or increased**
- Named: "Treatment-Prevalence Paradox" (TPP)
- Researchers' conclusion: "Significant prevalence reduction requires not only better treatment but foremost long-term structurally funded prevention targeting powerful determinants."

**Why it hits hard:** If treatment worked, more treatment should = less problem. It doesn't.

### Depression Relapse Rates

**Source:** [BMC Psychiatry](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-019-2382-2), [BJGP](https://bjgp.org/content/70/691/54)

- After first episode: **~50% relapse**
- After second episode: **~70% relapse**
- After third episode: **~90% relapse**
- **85%** recurrence within a decade
- **79%** of relapses occur within first 6 months

**Why it hits hard:** Treatment manages symptoms but the underlying process keeps firing.

### Youth Mental Health Crisis

**Sources:** [CDC MMWR 2023](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/su/su7304a9.htm), [JED Foundation](https://jedfoundation.org/mental-health-and-suicide-statistics/)

- Teen depression: **145%** increase (2010-2021)
- Suicide deaths (ages 10-24): **62%** increase (2007-2021)
- **1 in 5** high school students seriously considered suicide in 2023
- Preteen suicide (ages 8+): **8.2%** annual increase (2008-2022)

---

### Replication Crisis + NIMH/DSM

- **~40%** of psychology studies replicate
- NIMH stopped funding DSM-only research (2013)
- DSM diagnoses = "consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure" (Insel)

## HELPING CAN HURT: Iatrogenic Harm

### Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study (1939-present)

**Sources:** [Northeastern CSYS Archive](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/sccj/research/cambridge-somerville-youth-study/), [Freakonomics: "When Helping Hurts"](https://freakonomics.com/podcast-tag/cambridge-somerville-youth-study/)

**The Setup:**
- 506 underprivileged boys (ages 5-13) in Cambridge/Somerville, MA
- Matched pairs: one got treatment (counseling, mentorship, summer camp, medical visits), one didn't
- Random assignment by coin toss
- Intention: prevent delinquency through caring intervention

**The Shocking Result (Joan McCord's 30-year follow-up):**
Treatment group fared WORSE than control on:
- Criminal offending (more likely to commit 2+ crimes)
- Alcohol abuse
- Mental illness symptoms
- Occupational prestige
- Job satisfaction
- Stress-related disorders (high blood pressure, heart trouble)
- **Premature mortality** (death before 35)

**Joan McCord's reaction:** "No one had ever discussed the possibility that intervention—where you're going to a family and you're offering help or you're sending children to summer camp... that there is any potential for harmful effects."

**Key lesson:** "Unless social programs are evaluated for potential harm as well as benefit, safety as well as efficacy, the choice of which social programs to use will remain a dangerous guess."

### Scared Straight & DARE Programs

**Source:** [University of Kansas Study (2021)](https://news.ku.edu/news/article/2021/06/30/study-weighs-evidence-psychological-treatments-deemed-harmful-substantiating-negative), [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/some-psychological-interventions-are-more-harmful-than-helpful/)

**Scared Straight:**
- Exposed at-risk adolescents to inmates describing prison horrors
- Intended to scare them away from crime
- Result: "ineffective at best, and appreciably harmful at worst"
- Participants had WORSE outcomes than control

**DARE:**
- Implemented in 80% of U.S. school districts
- Abstinence-oriented "just say no" message
- Independent evaluations: did not lead to abstinence or even delay first drug use
- Young people saw peers experimenting without lives ruined → message didn't ring true

**The Pattern:** Well-intentioned helping, informed by intuition rather than measurement, can make things worse.

---

### The Female Temperament Problem in Therapy

**The Argument:**
- Therapy profession is overwhelmingly female or attracts female temperaments
- Female temperament defaults: accommodate, protect, align emotions, togetherness, unconditional positive regard
- What gets ignored: autonomy (emotional, intellectual, functional), healthy aggression, competitiveness, hard truths that hurt initially but help long-term
- "You're perfect just as you are" vs. "Here's what needs to change"
- Developmental maturity arguably = increasing autonomy, not increasing comfort

**Connection to Cambridge-Somerville:** The counselors were caring, attentive, supportive—and the kids did worse. Caring isn't enough. It can even hurt.

## MASS HYSTERIA & SOCIAL CONTAGION (Historical)

**Source:** [Wikipedia: Mass Psychogenic Illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_psychogenic_illness), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3536509/)

### Historical Cases

| Case | Date | What Happened |
|------|------|---------------|
| Dancing Plague of 1518 | 1518 | Hundreds danced for days until collapse/death |
| Convent hysterias | 15th-19th c. | Nuns exhibited possession-like behaviors |
| Salem Witch Trials | 1692 | Mass accusations, executions based on hysteria |
| June Bug Epidemic | 1962 | 62 textile workers developed mysterious illness—none organic |
| Tanganyika Laughing Epidemic | 1962 | 1,000+ affected, schools closed for weeks |
| TikTok Tics (2021) | 2021 | Sharp rise in Tourette's-like behavior in adolescent girls after YouTube channel went viral |

### Two Types of Mass Psychogenic Illness

1. **Anxiety hysteria** (Western): Sudden stress, foul odor, transient symptoms (dizziness, fainting). Resolves in 24 hours.
2. **Motor hysteria**: Long-term anxiety, motor agitation (twitching, shaking, trance states). Takes weeks/months to resolve.

**Key Point:** Mental phenomena spread through social networks. This is measurable, documented, and recurring throughout history. The problem is NOT contained in the individual.

## THERAPY FADS & CONCEPT CREEP

**Sources:** [Psychiatric Times](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/normality-endangered-species-psychiatric-fads-and-overdiagnosis), [PMC: Falling for Fads](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9567592/), [Mad in America: The Trauma Craze](https://www.madinamerica.com/2024/11/the-trauma-craze-how-the-expansion-of-trauma-diagnoses-fueled-victimhood-culture/)

### The Pattern

"Psychiatry is not immune to the effects of trends and fads, which are ideas that elicit short-lived enthusiasm, are quickly adopted, and abandoned when they fail to live up to expectations."

**Historical fads:**
- Hysteria → Schizophrenia → Multiple Personality Disorder → ADHD → Gender Identity Disorder

**Current fad: "Trauma"**
- Everyone uses the word
- Nobody can measure it
- Diagnostic expansion: "The definition of trauma and PTSD has expanded in a way that may be inflating prevalence rates"
- Paris (2015): "Trauma is only a risk factor for PTSD, not a definitive cause"

### Concept Creep

**Source:** [PMC: Concept Creep](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11804130/)

- Mental health concepts have broadened their meanings over decades
- People holding broad concepts are more likely to self-diagnose
- Groups most likely to self-diagnose: young adults, political progressives
- TikTok/Instagram: 60-second videos lead to self-diagnosis of ADHD, autism, etc.

**Why it matters:** Without clear, measurable definitions, concepts drift. Drift creates confusion. Confusion prevents coordination.

---

## WHY MEASURABILITY MATTERS

### The Common Currency Argument

Everyone knows what a dollar is. Every dollar is the same. This enables global markets.

Without common currency → barter → one person's valuation vs. another's → no coordination at scale.

### Facts as Depolarization

The first trick in family therapy where there are misaligned priorities and perspectives is to **gather all available facts**.

**What is a fact?** An important point about the problem at hand that everyone can easily agree on.

**What facts do:**
- Allow people to calm down
- Establish a common, depolarized baseline
- Create a starting point for addressing disagreements

**Without facts:** One person's opinions vs. another's → tribal/triangle hierarchy → emotionally determined outcomes.

### The Implicit Model

**Core Quote:** "The way a person understands a problem determines what they do to solve it."

- **Implicit model**: What people actually do (often unconscious)
- **Explicit model**: What people say they do

Current implicit model in behavioral health = problem is inside the individual. This determines everything: treatment approach, research design, funding, training.

## SOCIAL CONTAGION: The Wind Is Measurable

### Finnish Study (2024)

**Source:** [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240523112604.htm)

- 700,000 ninth-graders tracked
- Classmates with mental disorders → **9-18%** increased risk for you
- Strongest for mood, anxiety, eating disorders

**What this means:**
- Not what you'd expect if the problem were inside individuals
- Exactly what you'd expect if the problem were in systems
- The "wind" is measurable. We just haven't been measuring it.

---

## ATTACHMENT THEORY LIMITATION

**[TODO: LOCATE SPECIFIC CITATION]**

Study showing that children with "secure" attachment will present with disorganized attachment style if you get their parents to fight in the laboratory.

**Implication:** Attachment "style" is not a stable trait of the child—it's a function of the system state. Change the system, change the presentation.

---

## BOWEN CONCEPTS OVERVIEW (Second Half)

### 1. Differentiation of Self

The ability to maintain one's own emotional and intellectual functioning while remaining in contact with emotionally important people.

- Not isolation (cutoff)
- Not fusion (loss of self in togetherness)
- The capacity to be a self while being connected

### 2. Triangles

The basic molecule of emotional systems. When anxiety rises between two people, they pull in a third to stabilize.

- Predictable patterns
- Interlocking triangles form the family emotional system
- Observable and mappable

### 3. Nuclear Family Emotional System

Four patterns for managing anxiety in a nuclear family:
- Marital conflict
- Dysfunction in one spouse
- Impairment of one or more children
- Emotional distance

### 4. Family Projection Process

How parents transmit their emotional problems to a child:
- Focus on the child as the problem
- Interpret child's behavior through anxious lens
- Treat child as if interpretation is accurate
- Child responds to treatment, confirms interpretation

### 5. Multigenerational Transmission Process

How patterns are transmitted across generations:
- Each generation tends to produce some individuals with higher and lower differentiation
- Lower differentiation individuals tend to marry similar
- Over generations, functioning can decline significantly

### 6. Emotional Cutoff

Managing unresolved emotional issues with family by reducing or cutting off contact:
- Geographic distance
- Internal withdrawal while present
- Appears to solve the problem
- Actually intensifies it by reducing adaptive capacity
