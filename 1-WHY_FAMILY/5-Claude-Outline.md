# WHY FAMILY: The State of Behavioral Health

**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025 | 9:00-10:00 AM**
**60 minutes total (including Q&A)**

---

## CORE THESIS

**The One Sentence:** Everyone—not just scientists and engineers—needs scientific thinking.

**The Problem:** Without objective, measurable concepts, the behavioral health field adopts practices based on social contagion among professionals, not evidence. Once dogma sets in, it becomes religious fact. Certain perspectives become untouchable.

**The Enemy:** The assumption that intuition and caring are sufficient—that scientific rigor is optional for helping professions.

**The Smallest Viable Win:** Convince the audience that measurable concepts are not just nice-to-have but essential for any field that wants to actually help.

## I. OPENING: The Engineer's Confession (3 min)

- Your story: engineer enters behavioral health field
- Expected: if it doesn't work, measure it, fix it, or discard it
- Found: a field that doesn't work that way
- *"I'm not here to attack anyone's training. I'm here to make a case that everyone—not just engineers—needs scientific thinking."*

**Transition:** *"Let me show you why I think that."*

---

## II. THE FIELD IS BROKEN: The Data (10 min)

Present without editorializing. Let them land.

### 1. The Treatment-Prevalence Paradox

- Treatment for depression **increased 4x** from 1987-2007
- Prevalence of depression: **stayed the same or increased**
- *"More treatment does not mean less depression."*

### 2. The Relapse Problem

- After first episode: **50% relapse**
- After second: **70%**. After third: **90%**
- 85% recurrence within a decade
- *"We're managing symptoms. The fire keeps getting relit."*

### 3. The Youth Crisis

- Teen depression: **145% increase** (2010-2021)
- Suicide deaths ages 10-24: **62% increase** (2007-2021)
- More therapists, more spending, more awareness than ever
- *"Whatever we're doing, it's not working."*

### 4. The Institutional Collapse

- ~40% of psychology studies replicate
- NIMH stopped funding DSM-only research (2013)
- *"The largest funder of mental health research lost confidence in our diagnostic system."*

**Transition:** *"Why? How does a field stay broken this long?"*

---

## III. WHY? SOCIAL CONTAGION IN THE PROFESSION (15 min)

**Key Point:** Without scientific/measurable concepts, the field doesn't self-correct through evidence. It drifts based on social dynamics among professionals.

### A. Practices Spread Socially, Not Scientifically (5 min)

**DARE:**
- Implemented in **80% of U.S. school districts**
- Independent evaluations: did not reduce drug use or even delay first use
- Kept going for decades anyway
- *How did 80% adoption happen without evidence? Social contagion among administrators and educators.*

**Scared Straight:**
- Exposed at-risk kids to prison inmates
- Result: participants did **WORSE** than control
- Program continued and spread anyway
- *The idea felt right. It spread. Evidence didn't matter.*

**Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study:**
- 506 boys, matched pairs, random assignment
- Treatment: counseling, mentorship, summer camp, caring adults
- 30-year result: treatment group had **more crime, more alcoholism, more mental illness, earlier death**
- Joan McCord: *"No one had ever discussed the possibility that intervention... has any potential for harmful effects."*

*"Well-intentioned helping, informed by intuition rather than measurement, spread through the profession. It made things worse."*

### B. Concepts Drift Into Dogma (5 min)

**Historical Fads:**
- Hysteria → Schizophrenia → Multiple Personality Disorder → ADHD → "Trauma"
- Each wave: initial enthusiasm, mass adoption, eventual abandonment (or not)

**Current Example: "Trauma"**
- Everyone uses the word
- Nobody can measure it
- Definition keeps expanding: "The definition of trauma and PTSD has expanded in a way that may be inflating prevalence rates"
- Paris (2015): "Trauma is only a risk factor for PTSD, not a definitive cause"

**The Pattern:**
- Without measurable definitions, concepts drift
- Drift is driven by social dynamics, not evidence
- Once enough people adopt it, it becomes **dogma**
- Dogma becomes **religious fact**
- Questioning it makes you a heretic

*"Without measurement, there's no way to know if a concept is helping or hurting. So concepts spread based on how they feel, who's promoting them, and what's socially safe to say."*

### C. Certain Perspectives Become Untouchable (5 min)

**The Blind Spot:**
- Therapy profession is overwhelmingly female or attracts female temperaments
- Default emphasis: accommodate, protect, align emotions, togetherness, unconditional positive regard
- What gets ignored: autonomy, healthy aggression, hard truths that hurt initially but help long-term
- "You're perfect just as you are" vs. "Here's what needs to change"

**Cambridge-Somerville Again:**
- The counselors were caring, attentive, supportive
- The kids did worse
- *Caring isn't enough. It can even hurt.*

**The Problem:**
- Traditional masculine perspectives—autonomy, challenge, accountability—become **unmentionable**
- Not because they're wrong, but because they're **socially uncomfortable** in a field dominated by a particular temperament
- Without scientific thinking, social comfort determines what's acceptable to discuss

*"When a field lacks objective frameworks, it doesn't gravitate toward truth. It gravitates toward social consensus. And social consensus has blind spots."*

**Transition:** *"So what's the antidote?"*

---

## IV. WHAT'S MISSING: Scientific Thinking (10 min)

### The Implicit Model

- *"The way you understand a problem determines what you do to solve it."*
- **Implicit model:** What people actually do (often unconscious)
- **Explicit model:** What people say they do
- Current implicit model in behavioral health: "Caring + intuition is enough. Measurement is optional."
- This determines everything: treatment, training, what's acceptable to question

### Why Measurability Matters

**The Common Currency Argument:**
- Everyone knows what a dollar is → global markets possible
- Without common currency → barter → no coordination at scale
- Without measurable concepts → opinion vs. opinion → no way to settle disagreements except socially

**Facts Calm People Down:**
- First move in family therapy with misaligned perspectives: **gather facts**
- What is a fact? Something everyone can easily agree on
- Facts establish a **depolarized baseline**
- Without facts: tribal hierarchy → emotionally determined outcomes → the loudest or most socially powerful voice wins

### Scientific Thinking Is Not Just for Scientists

- Scientific thinking = "What would have to be true for me to be wrong?"
- It's the willingness to be **falsified**
- Cambridge-Somerville, DARE, Scared Straight: nobody asked "what if this hurts?"
- *"A field that doesn't ask 'what if we're wrong?' will stay wrong indefinitely."*

**The Invitation:**
- This isn't about becoming a researcher
- It's about demanding measurable outcomes
- It's about asking "how would we know if this doesn't work?"
- It's about being willing to let evidence override intuition

---

## V. THE PROPOSAL: Family as Unit + Measurability (12 min)

### The Blade of Grass

- Studying a blade of grass to understand why it bends
- Measuring angle, cellular structure, position
- Still can't predict movement
- Because the grass isn't the phenomenon. **The wind is.**
- *"We've spent 80 years studying individuals. The pattern is in the system."*

### Why Family?

- Family is the smallest system where the pattern is visible
- Not society (too big, too abstract, can't intervene)
- Not the individual (too small, misses the pattern)
- One level up from the blade of grass

### What You'll Get Today

The rest of today gives you **measurable concepts** for looking at the family level:

| Session | What You'll Get |
|---------|-----------------|
| **SARF** | Six relationship patterns you can observe and track |
| **AI Tools** | Technology to capture what we're learning to see |
| **App Demo** | Practical tools you can use Monday |
| **Clinical Case** | Evidence it works in practice |

### The Call to Action

*"Before your next intake, draw the family."*

But more importantly:

*"Before your next intervention, ask: how would I know if this is making things worse?"*

---

## VI. Q&A / CLARIFYING QUESTIONS (10 min)

Likely questions:
- "Are you saying therapy doesn't work?"
- "What about individual factors like genetics?"
- "How do I apply scientific thinking without being a researcher?"
- "What do I do Monday?"

---

## WHAT GOT CUT

| Topic | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Finnish study / TikTok tics | Social contagion reframed—not about illness spreading, about practices spreading |
| Six Bowen concepts | Moved to SARF session |
| Detailed mass hysteria history | Not the point anymore |
| Attachment study | Needs citation; tangential to this argument |

## SLIDES (Minimal)

1. Title slide
2. "4x more treatment. Same depression."
3. "50% → 70% → 90%"
4. "DARE: 80% of schools. No effect."
5. "Cambridge-Somerville: Helped = Worse"
6. Therapy fads timeline: Hysteria → MPD → ADHD → Trauma
7. "Without measurement, concepts drift into dogma."
8. Blade of grass + wind
9. "Everyone needs scientific thinking."
10. "Before your next intake, draw the family."
