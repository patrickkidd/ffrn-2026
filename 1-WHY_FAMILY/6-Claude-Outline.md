# WHY FAMILY: The State of Behavioral Health

**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025 | 9:00-10:00 AM**
**60 minutes total (including Q&A)**

---

## CORE THESIS

**The One Sentence:** Everyone—not just scientists and engineers—needs scientific thinking.

**The Problem:** Without objective, measurable concepts, the behavioral health field adopts practices based on social contagion among professionals. Emotion becomes the glue that holds the dogma together. Once belief sets in, it becomes religious fact—immune to evidence, and questioning it makes you a heretic. Certain perspectives become untouchable.

**The Pattern:** Throughout history, when helping professions lack objective frameworks, they repeatedly fall into collective belief systems that:
1. Have no objective evidence
2. Have no clear way to test validity
3. Are held together by emotional investment
4. End in total calamity

**The Smallest Viable Win:** Convince the audience that measurable concepts aren't optional—they're the only protection against becoming the next cautionary tale.

## I. OPENING: The Engineer's Confession (3 min)

- Your story: engineer enters behavioral health field
- Expected: if it doesn't work, measure it, fix it, or discard it
- Found: a field that doesn't work that way
- *"I'm not here to attack anyone's training. I'm here to make a case that everyone—not just engineers—needs scientific thinking. Because without it, good intentions lead to catastrophe."*

**Transition:** *"Let me show you why I think that."*

---

## II. THE FIELD IS BROKEN: The Data (8 min)

### 1. The Treatment-Prevalence Paradox

- Treatment for depression **increased 4x** from 1987-2007
- Prevalence of depression: **stayed the same or increased**
- *"More treatment does not mean less depression."*

### 2. The Relapse Problem

- After first episode: **50% relapse**
- After second: **70%**. After third: **90%**
- *"The fire keeps getting relit."*

### 3. The Youth Crisis

- Teen depression: **145% increase** (2010-2021)
- Suicide deaths ages 10-24: **62% increase**
- More therapists, more spending, more awareness than ever

### 4. The Institutional Collapse

- ~40% of psychology studies replicate
- NIMH stopped funding DSM-only research (2013)

**Transition:** *"How does a field stay broken this long? Let me show you a pattern."*

---

## III. THE PATTERN: Historical Catastrophes (18 min)

**Setup:** These aren't ancient history. These are cases where caring professionals, lacking objective frameworks, got swept up in collective beliefs that destroyed lives. The pattern repeats because the conditions repeat.

### A. Salem Witch Trials (1692) — 2 min

**The Belief:** Witches were among us, identifiable by symptoms and accusations.

**The Evidence:** Spectral evidence, fits, accusations from afflicted girls.

**The Outcome:**
- **25+ dead** (19 hanged, 1 pressed to death, 5+ died in prison)
- **200+ accused**
- Families destroyed, community torn apart

**The End:** Within years, the court admitted error. Jurors signed public apologies.

---

### B. Lobotomy Epidemic (1940s-1950s) — 3 min

**The Belief:** Mental illness could be cured by severing brain connections.

**The Evidence:** Patients seemed "calmer" afterward.

**The Outcome:**
- **50,000+ lobotomies** performed in the US alone
- **~5% mortality rate**
- Thousands left with permanent damage: loss of personality, incontinence, cognitive impairment
- Walter Freeman performed **4,000 personally**—including on a **4-year-old**
- Rosemary Kennedy lobotomized at 23, permanently incapacitated
- Freeman banned from surgery in 1967 after a patient death

**The End:** Soviet Union banned lobotomies in 1950 as "contrary to the principles of humanity." The US took another two decades.

*"Freeman won awards. He toured the country in a van called the 'Lobotomobile.' He was celebrated—until he wasn't."*

---

### C. "Refrigerator Mother" Theory (1950s-1970s) — 3 min

**The Belief:** Autism was caused by cold, unloving mothers.

**The Evidence:** Psychoanalytic interpretation. The children seemed withdrawn; the mothers seemed reserved.

**The Proponent:** Bruno Bettelheim—later discovered to have **lied about his credentials** and **abused patients**.

**The Outcome:**
- Mothers blamed for their children's neurological condition
- Immense guilt and shame
- Children institutionalized because "the mother was the problem"
- Families destroyed

**The End:** Bernard Rimland (father of an autistic son) published counter-evidence in 1964. Kanner recanted in 1969. Bettelheim's fraud exposed upon his death in 1990.

*"For 20 years, mothers were told they caused their children's autism. There was no evidence. There was no way to test it. But it felt true to the experts."*

---

### D. Recovered Memory Therapy (1980s-1990s) — 4 min

**The Belief:** Repressed memories of childhood abuse could be "recovered" through hypnosis and suggestion.

**The Evidence:** Patients "remembered" abuse under therapeutic guidance.

**The Outcome:**
- Estimated **1 million patients** convinced they had repressed memories (UC Berkeley estimate)
- **"Tens of thousands of families"** destroyed by false accusations
- Parents, teachers, relatives falsely accused of incest, satanic abuse
- Many **imprisoned** on the sole evidence of "recovered" memories
- Patients who underwent the therapy showed **decline** in mental health

**The End:** Malpractice suits, license revocations, fraud charges. Elizabeth Loftus's research on memory malleability. FBI found **zero evidence** of the satanic ritual abuse that kept emerging in sessions.

*"A million people were told they had memories they didn't have. Families were torn apart. People went to prison. And therapists believed they were helping."*

---

### E. Satanic Panic / Daycare Ritual Abuse (1980s-1990s) — 3 min

**The Belief:** Satanic cults were ritually abusing children in daycare centers across America.

**The Evidence:** Children's testimony—elicited through leading questions, pressure, and rewards.

**The Outcome:**
- **12,000+ cases** alleged nationwide
- **McMartin Preschool:** 7 years, $15 million, **zero convictions**. Children claimed they saw witches fly, were flushed down toilets to secret rooms.
- **Ray Buckey:** 5 years in jail before charges dropped
- **Dan & Fran Keller:** imprisoned, released in 2013, ruled innocent in 2017
- **Wenatchee, WA:** 43 adults arrested on **29,726 charges**. Parents, Sunday school teachers, a pastor. Later found negligent; $3 million awarded to wrongly accused couple.
- Dozens of wrongful convictions. No governor has ever pardoned a single one.

**The End:** FBI's Lanning Report found no evidence. Systematic analysis showed interviews were "highly suggestive." Reforms in how children are interviewed.

*"Twelve thousand cases. Zero evidence. Careers destroyed, families shattered, people imprisoned—because it felt true."*

---

### F. MPD/DID Epidemic (1980s-1990s) — 3 min

**The Belief:** Multiple Personality Disorder was widespread, caused by repressed trauma, and could be uncovered through therapy.

**The Evidence:** Patients developed "alters" during treatment.

**The Outcome:**
- **50,000 diagnoses** by the 1990s (vs. ~200 cases in all prior history)
- Closely tied to recovered memory therapy and satanic panic
- Patients got worse, not better
- Many MPD clinics eventually closed
- Therapist licenses revoked

**The End:** Research showed DID was largely **iatrogenic**—created by the therapy itself. The "epidemic" disappeared when the practices stopped.

*"Before 1980: rare. After therapists started looking for it: 50,000 cases. After they stopped: rare again. The 'disease' followed the treatment."*

### THE COMMON PATTERN

| Element | Present in All Cases |
|---------|---------------------|
| No objective evidence | ✓ |
| No way to test validity | ✓ |
| Emotion as the glue | Fear, care, outrage |
| Spread through professionals | ✓ |
| Ended in calamity | Deaths, imprisonment, families destroyed |

**Transition:** *"Why does this keep happening?"*

---

## IV. WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING (10 min)

### A. Without Measurement, Social Dynamics Rule

- When concepts can't be tested, they spread based on:
  - Who promotes them
  - How they feel
  - What's socially safe to say
- DARE was in **80% of schools**—despite no evidence it worked
- Cambridge-Somerville: caring intervention made kids **worse**—more crime, earlier death

*"When there's no objective test, the field doesn't self-correct through evidence. It drifts based on social consensus."*

### B. Once Belief Sets In, It Becomes Religious

- Questioning the belief makes you suspect
- Bettelheim's critics were dismissed as defenders of bad mothers
- Questioning recovered memories meant you were "protecting abusers"
- The emotion invested in the belief becomes the glue

*"The more emotion invested, the harder it is to question. That's not science. That's religion."*

### C. Certain Perspectives Become Untouchable

**The Blind Spot:**
- Therapy profession attracts/selects for particular temperaments
- Default emphasis: accommodate, protect, align emotions, unconditional positive regard
- What gets ignored: autonomy, healthy challenge, hard truths
- "You're perfect just as you are" vs. "Here's what needs to change"

**Cambridge-Somerville Again:**
- The counselors were caring, attentive, supportive
- The kids did worse
- *Caring isn't enough. It can even hurt.*

*"Without objective frameworks, social comfort determines what's acceptable to discuss. And social comfort has blind spots."*

---

## V. THE PROPOSAL: Scientific Thinking + Family (11 min)

### Scientific Thinking Is the Antidote

- Scientific thinking = "What would have to be true for me to be wrong?"
- It's the willingness to be **falsified**
- Nobody in these cases asked: "What if we're making it worse?"

*"A field that doesn't ask 'what if we're wrong?' will eventually be wrong in catastrophic ways."*

### Why Measurability Matters

**The Common Currency Argument:**
- Everyone knows what a dollar is → global markets
- Without common currency → barter → no coordination
- Without measurable concepts → opinion vs. opinion → loudest voice wins

**Facts Calm People Down:**
- First move in family therapy: **gather facts**
- Facts establish a depolarized baseline
- Without facts: tribal hierarchy → emotionally determined outcomes

### The Blade of Grass

- Studying a blade of grass to understand why it bends
- Measuring angle, position, structure
- Still can't predict movement
- Because the grass isn't the phenomenon. **The wind is.**
- *"We've spent 80 years studying individuals."*

### Why Family?

- Family is the smallest system where the pattern is visible
- Not society (too big, can't intervene)
- Not the individual (misses the pattern)
- One level up from the blade of grass

### What You'll Get Today

| Session | What You'll Get |
|---------|-----------------|
| **SARF** | Measurable concepts for family-level patterns |
| **AI Tools** | Technology to capture what we're learning to see |
| **App Demo** | Practical tools you can use Monday |
| **Clinical Case** | Evidence it works |

### The Call to Action

*"Before your next intake, draw the family."*

*"Before your next intervention, ask: how would I know if this is making things worse?"*
