# WHY FAMILY: The State of Behavioral Health

**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025 | 9:00-10:00 AM**
**60 minutes total (including Q&A)**

---

## CORE THESIS

**The One Sentence:** Everyone—not just scientists and engineers—needs scientific thinking.

**The Problem:** Without objective, measurable concepts, the behavioral health field adopts practices based on social contagion among professionals. Emotion becomes the glue that holds the dogma together. Once belief sets in, it becomes religious fact—immune to evidence, and questioning it makes you a heretic.

**The Deeper Explanation:** These contagions occur in response to anxiety. When people perceive uncertainty and urgency, they seek any way to reduce that uncertainty. Untestable, oversimplified ideologies provide relief—people *feel* calmer—but at great expense. The true problem remains unaddressed, and the anxious response often creates more damage than the original problem.

**The Smallest Viable Win:** Convince the audience that measurable concepts aren't optional—they're the only protection against becoming the next cautionary tale.

## I. OPENING: The Engineer's Confession (3 min)

- Your story: engineer enters behavioral health field
- Expected: if it doesn't work, measure it, fix it, or discard it
- Found: a field that doesn't work that way
- *"I'm not here to attack anyone's training. I'm here to make a case that everyone—not just engineers—needs scientific thinking. Because without it, good intentions lead to catastrophe."*

**Transition:** *"Let me show you why I think that."*

---

## II. THE FIELD IS BROKEN: The Data (8 min)

### 1. The Treatment-Prevalence Paradox

- Treatment for depression **increased 4x** from 1987-2007
- Prevalence of depression: **stayed the same or increased**
- *"More treatment does not mean less depression."*

### 2. The Relapse Problem

- After first episode: **50% relapse**
- After second: **70%**. After third: **90%**
- *"The fire keeps getting relit."*

### 3. The Youth Crisis

- Teen depression: **145% increase** (2010-2021)
- Suicide deaths ages 10-24: **62% increase**
- More therapists, more spending, more awareness than ever

### 4. The Institutional Collapse

- ~40% of psychology studies replicate
- NIMH stopped funding DSM-only research (2013)

**Transition:** *"How does a field stay broken this long? Let me show you a pattern."*

---

## III. THE PATTERN: Historical Catastrophes (15 min)

**Setup:** These aren't ancient history. These are cases where caring professionals, lacking objective frameworks, got swept up in collective beliefs that destroyed lives.

### A. Salem Witch Trials (1692)

**The Belief:** Witches were among us, identifiable by symptoms and accusations.

**The Outcome:**
- **25+ dead** (19 hanged, 1 pressed to death, 5+ died in prison)
- **200+ accused**
- Families destroyed, community torn apart

**The End:** Within years, jurors signed public apologies.

---

### B. Lobotomy Epidemic (1940s-1950s)

**The Belief:** Mental illness could be cured by severing brain connections.

**The Outcome:**
- **50,000+ lobotomies** in the US
- **~5% mortality rate**
- Thousands left with permanent damage
- Walter Freeman performed **4,000 personally**—including on a **4-year-old**
- Rosemary Kennedy permanently incapacitated

**The End:** Soviet Union banned lobotomies in 1950 as "contrary to the principles of humanity." Freeman was celebrated—until he wasn't.

---

### C. "Refrigerator Mother" Theory (1950s-1970s)

**The Belief:** Autism was caused by cold, unloving mothers.

**The Outcome:**
- **20 years** of blaming mothers for their children's neurological condition
- Immense guilt, shame, families destroyed
- Children institutionalized

**The End:** Bettelheim (the main proponent) later exposed as fraud who **lied about credentials** and **abused patients**.

---

### D. Recovered Memory Therapy (1980s-1990s)

**The Belief:** Repressed memories of abuse could be "recovered" through therapy.

**The Outcome:**
- Est. **1 million patients** convinced they had repressed memories
- **"Tens of thousands of families"** destroyed by false accusations
- People **imprisoned** on sole evidence of "recovered" memories

**The End:** Malpractice suits, license revocations. FBI found **zero evidence** of the satanic abuse emerging in sessions.

---

### E. Satanic Panic / Daycare Abuse (1980s-1990s)

**The Belief:** Satanic cults were ritually abusing children in daycares.

**The Outcome:**
- **12,000+ cases** alleged
- **McMartin Preschool:** 7 years, $15 million, **zero convictions**
- Dozens of wrongful convictions, people imprisoned for years
- Careers destroyed, families shattered

**The End:** FBI's Lanning Report found no evidence. Reforms in child interviewing.

---

### F. MPD/DID Epidemic (1980s-1990s)

**The Belief:** Multiple personalities were widespread, caused by repressed trauma.

**The Outcome:**
- **50,000 diagnoses** by 1990s (vs. ~200 in all prior history)
- Patients got worse, not better
- MPD clinics closed, licenses revoked

**The End:** Research showed it was largely **iatrogenic**—created by the therapy itself. The "epidemic" disappeared when the practices stopped.

### THE COMMON PATTERN

| Element | Present in All Cases |
|---------|---------------------|
| No objective evidence | ✓ |
| No way to test validity | ✓ |
| Emotion as the glue | Fear, care, outrage |
| Spread through professionals | ✓ |
| Ended in calamity | Deaths, imprisonment, families destroyed |

### WHAT ABOUT NOW?

*"I want to pause here and invite you to wonder: What social contagions might be happening right now? What topics feel off-limits to question? What beliefs are held with such emotional intensity that questioning them makes you suspect?"*

*"I'm not going to name them. You can think of your own. But I want to be clear about something: I have deep respect for the power of these forces. They are not to be taken lightly. They are not an invitation to convenient rebellion."*

*"These forces are real. They serve a function—I believe a biological function. The question is not whether they exist, but whether we can recognize them and respond more thoughtfully than our ancestors did."*

**Transition:** *"Which brings us to the question: Why does this keep happening?"*

---

## IV. WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING: Anxiety (12 min)

### A. Anxiety = Perceived Uncertainty + Urgency

**Core concept:** Anxiety occurs when people perceive **uncertainty** combined with **urgency**.

- Something in the environment—or in relationships—creates this perception
- When anxious, the first thing people do is **look for a way to reduce uncertainty**
- Any explanation feels better than no explanation

### B. The Ideology Provides Relief

**What all these contagions have in common:**

They offer an explanation that is:
1. **Untestable** (unassailable—you can't prove it wrong)
2. **Simple** (but oversimplified)

This combination is powerful:
- It "explains" the problem
- It cuts the uncertainty
- People *perceive* that the uncertainty has gone away
- They calm down

*"The ideology provides psychological relief. The believers feel better. That's why it spreads."*

### C. Short-Term Relief, Long-Term Catastrophe

**The trade-off:**

- **Short-term:** The ideology solves the suffering of anxiety for believers
- **Long-term:** It obscures and fails to address the true problem—which is that these problems are not well understood

**The anxious response creates more damage than the original problem.**

**The band-aid analogy:**
- One person reacts to a cut knee by calmly applying a band-aid
- Another runs into the house screaming bloody murder, breaking furniture, distressing their spouse who leaves the stove on rushing to the hospital, burning the house down, leaving the family homeless

*"The most intense anxious responses do so much damage that they create more problems than they solve. That's what we saw in every one of these historical cases."*

### D. Why Caring Professions Are Vulnerable

- Caring professions attract people who want to help
- When faced with suffering, there's urgency to do *something*
- Uncertainty about what works is intolerable
- Any framework that promises clarity is appealing
- Questioning the framework feels like abandoning the suffering

**Cambridge-Somerville again:**
- Counselors were caring, attentive, supportive
- Kids did worse: more crime, more alcoholism, earlier death
- *"Caring isn't enough. Without measurement, caring can hurt."*

### E. Without Measurement, Social Dynamics Rule

- When concepts can't be tested, they spread based on:
  - Who promotes them
  - How they feel
  - What's socially safe to say
- Once belief sets in, questioning makes you a heretic
- The emotion invested becomes the glue

*"Without measurement, there's no way to know if a concept is helping or hurting. So concepts spread based on social dynamics, not evidence. And once enough people believe, it becomes religious fact."*

---

## V. THE PROPOSAL: Scientific Thinking + Family (12 min)

### Scientific Thinking Is the Antidote

- Scientific thinking = "What would have to be true for me to be wrong?"
- It's the willingness to be **falsified**
- Nobody in these historical cases asked: "What if we're making it worse?"

*"A field that doesn't ask 'what if we're wrong?' will eventually be wrong in catastrophic ways."*

### Why Measurability Matters

**The Common Currency Argument:**
- Everyone knows what a dollar is → global markets
- Without common currency → barter → no coordination
- Without measurable concepts → opinion vs. opinion → loudest voice wins

**Facts Calm People Down:**
- First move in family therapy: **gather facts**
- Facts establish a depolarized baseline
- Without facts: tribal hierarchy → emotionally determined outcomes

*"Measurability doesn't just enable coordination. It provides a healthier way to reduce uncertainty than ideology. Facts calm people down without the catastrophic side effects."*

### The Blade of Grass

- Studying a blade of grass to understand why it bends
- Measuring angle, position, structure
- Still can't predict movement
- Because the grass isn't the phenomenon. **The wind is.**
- *"We've spent 80 years studying individuals."*

### Why Family?

- Family is the smallest system where the pattern is visible
- Not society (too big, can't intervene)
- Not the individual (misses the pattern)
- One level up from the blade of grass

### What You'll Get Today

| Session | What You'll Get |
|---------|-----------------|
| **SARF** | Measurable concepts for family-level patterns—including "A" for anxiety |
| **AI Tools** | Technology to capture what we're learning to see |
| **App Demo** | Practical tools you can use Monday |
| **Clinical Case** | Evidence it works |

### The Call to Action

*"Before your next intake, draw the family."*

*"Before your next intervention, ask: how would I know if this is making things worse?"*
