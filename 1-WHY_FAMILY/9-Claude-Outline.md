# WHY FAMILY: The State of Behavioral Health

**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025 | 9:00-10:00 AM**
**60 minutes total (including Q&A)**

---

## A NOTE ON SCOPE

*"I'll be speaking in the context of clinical psychology since it's a formalized domain with the most concrete examples. But these patterns apply across all helping professions—LCSW, LPC, MFT, and others. Clinical psychology is the lowest common denominator; the issues I'll describe translate across licenses."*

---

## CORE THESIS

**The One Sentence:** Everyone—not just scientists and engineers—needs scientific thinking.

**The Problem:** Without objective, measurable concepts, helping professions adopt practices based on social contagion among professionals, not evidence. Concepts drift into dogma. Dogma becomes religious fact. Certain perspectives become untouchable.

**Why It Happens:** These contagions occur in response to anxiety (perceived uncertainty + urgency). Untestable, oversimplified ideologies provide psychological relief—but at great expense. The true problem remains unaddressed, and the anxious response often creates more damage than the original problem.

**Why It Matters:** These forces are *real*, serve a *function*—likely a *biological* function. They are not to be taken lightly or used as convenient rebellion. The question is whether we can recognize them and respond more thoughtfully.

**The Proposal:** Shift the unit of analysis from individual to family. Family is the smallest system where patterns are visible. Measurable concepts at this level provide a healthier way to reduce uncertainty than ideology.

## I. OPENING: The Engineer's Confession (3 min)

- Your story: engineer enters behavioral health field
- Expected: if it doesn't work, measure it, fix it, or discard it
- Found: a field that doesn't work that way
- *"I'm not here to attack anyone's training. I'm here to make a case that everyone—not just engineers—needs scientific thinking."*

**Transition:** *"Let me show you the data."*

## II. THE FIELD IS BROKEN: The Data (8 min)

### 1. The Treatment-Prevalence Paradox (CENTERPIECE)

**Source:** [Ormel et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735821001549)

- Treatment for depression **increased 4x** from 1987-2007
- Prevalence of depression: **stayed the same or increased**
- Researchers' conclusion: "Significant prevalence reduction requires not only better treatment but foremost long-term structurally funded prevention targeting powerful determinants."
- *"More treatment does not mean less depression."*

### 2. The Relapse Problem

**Source:** [BMC Psychiatry](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-019-2382-2), [BJGP](https://bjgp.org/content/70/691/54)

- After first episode: **50% relapse**
- After second: **70%**. After third: **90%**
- **85%** recurrence within a decade
- **79%** of relapses occur within first 6 months
- *"The fire keeps getting relit."*

### 3. The Youth Crisis

**Source:** [CDC MMWR 2023](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/su/su7304a9.htm), [JED Foundation](https://jedfoundation.org/mental-health-and-suicide-statistics/)

- Teen depression: **145% increase** (2010-2021)
- Suicide deaths ages 10-24: **62% increase** (2007-2021)
- **1 in 5** high school students seriously considered suicide in 2023
- Preteen suicide (ages 8+): **8.2%** annual increase (2008-2022)
- More therapists, more spending, more awareness than ever

### 4. The Replication Crisis

**Source:** [Northwestern IPR](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/news/2024/an-existential-crisis-for-science.html)

- **~40%** of psychology studies replicate
- *"The research base itself is unreliable."*

### 5. The Institutional Loss of Confidence

- **NIMH stopped funding DSM-only research** (2013)
- Thomas Insel (then NIMH Director): DSM diagnoses are "consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure"
- *"The field's own institutions have lost confidence in its diagnostic framework."*

### Supporting Point: Public Skepticism

**Source:** [Roper Center / Psychology Today polls](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/public-attitudes-about-mental-health)

- **43%** say costs of therapy outweigh benefits (2004)
- **38%** believe most therapists need therapy themselves (2004)
- Public perceives therapy effective in only **26-50%** of cases
- Psychiatrists rated lower than doctors, nurses, pharmacists, even dentists for honesty/ethics (2012)

*"The public senses something is wrong—even if they can't articulate it. This skepticism has a basis."*

**Transition:** *"How does a field stay broken this long? Let me show you a pattern."*

---

## III. THE PATTERN: Historical Catastrophes (14 min)

**Setup:** These aren't ancient history. These are cases where caring professionals, lacking objective frameworks, got swept up in collective beliefs that destroyed lives. The pattern repeats because the conditions repeat.

*See detailed summaries in `./articles/` for full background and sources.*

**Full summary:** [articles/Salem-Witch-Trials.md](../articles/Salem-Witch-Trials.md)

**The Belief:** Witches identifiable by symptoms and accusations.
**The Evidence:** Spectral evidence, fits, accusations.
**The Outcome:** **25+ dead**, **200+ accused**, families destroyed.
**The End:** Within years, jurors signed public apologies.

### B. Lobotomy Epidemic (1940s-1950s)

**Full summary:** [articles/Lobotomy-Epidemic.md](../articles/Lobotomy-Epidemic.md)

**The Belief:** Mental illness cured by severing brain connections.
**The Evidence:** Patients seemed "calmer."
**The Outcome:**
- **50,000+ lobotomies** in the US
- **~5% mortality rate**
- Thousands with permanent damage
- Walter Freeman performed **4,000 personally**—on patients as young as **4**

### C. "Refrigerator Mother" Theory (1950s-1970s)

**Full summary:** [articles/Refrigerator-Mother-Theory.md](../articles/Refrigerator-Mother-Theory.md)

**The Belief:** Autism caused by cold, unloving mothers.
**The Evidence:** Psychoanalytic interpretation.
**The Outcome:** **20 years** blaming mothers. Immense guilt. Children institutionalized.
**The End:** Bettelheim (main proponent) exposed as fraud who **lied about credentials** and **abused patients**.

### D. Recovered Memory Therapy (1980s-1990s)

**Full summary:** [articles/Recovered-Memory-Therapy.md](../articles/Recovered-Memory-Therapy.md)

**The Belief:** Repressed memories recoverable through therapy.
**The Evidence:** Patients "remembered" under guidance.
**The Outcome:**
- Est. **1 million patients** convinced they had repressed memories
- **"Tens of thousands of families"** destroyed
- People **imprisoned** on false accusations

**The End:** Malpractice suits, license revocations. FBI found **zero evidence** of satanic abuse.

### F. MPD/DID Epidemic (1980s-1990s)

**Full summary:** [articles/MPD-DID-Epidemic.md](../articles/MPD-DID-Epidemic.md)

**The Belief:** Multiple personalities widespread, caused by repressed trauma.
**The Evidence:** Patients developed "alters" during treatment.
**The Outcome:** **50,000 diagnoses** by 1990s (vs. ~200 in all prior history). Patients got worse.
**The End:** Largely **iatrogenic**—created by the therapy. Epidemic disappeared when practices stopped.

### THE COMMON PATTERN

| Element | Present in All Cases |
|---------|---------------------|
| No objective evidence | ✓ |
| No way to test validity | ✓ |
| Emotion as the glue | Fear, care, outrage |
| Spread through professionals | ✓ |
| Ended in calamity | Deaths, imprisonment, families destroyed |

---

### WHAT ABOUT NOW?

*"I want to pause and invite you to wonder: What social contagions might be happening right now? What topics feel off-limits to question? What beliefs are held with such emotional intensity that questioning them makes you suspect?"*

*"I'm not going to name them. You can think of your own."*

*"But I want to be clear: I have deep respect for the power of these forces. They are not to be taken lightly. They are not an invitation to convenient rebellion."*

*"These forces are real. They serve a function—I believe a biological function. The question is not whether they exist, but whether we can recognize them and respond more thoughtfully than our ancestors did."*

**Transition:** *"Which brings us to: Why does this keep happening?"*

---

## IV. WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING: Anxiety (12 min)

### A. Anxiety = Perceived Uncertainty + Urgency

**Core concept (the "A" in SARF):** Anxiety occurs when people perceive **uncertainty** combined with **urgency**.

- Something in the environment—or in relationships—creates this perception
- When anxious, the first thing people do is **look for a way to reduce uncertainty**
- Any explanation feels better than no explanation

### B. The Ideology Provides Relief

**What all these contagions have in common:**

They offer an explanation that is:
1. **Untestable** (unassailable—you can't prove it wrong)
2. **Simple** (but oversimplified)

This combination is powerful:
- It "explains" the problem
- It cuts the uncertainty
- People *perceive* uncertainty has gone away
- They calm down

*"The ideology provides psychological relief. The believers feel better. That's why it spreads."*

### C. Short-Term Relief, Long-Term Catastrophe

- **Short-term:** The ideology solves the suffering of anxiety for believers
- **Long-term:** It obscures the true problem—which is that these problems are not well understood

**The anxious response creates more damage than the original problem.**

**The band-aid analogy:**
- One person reacts to a cut knee by calmly applying a band-aid
- Another runs into the house screaming bloody murder, breaking furniture, distressing their spouse who leaves the stove on rushing to the hospital, burning the house down

*"The most intense anxious responses create more problems than they solve."*

### D. Why Caring Professions Are Especially Vulnerable

- Caring professions attract people who want to help
- Suffering creates urgency
- Uncertainty about what works is intolerable
- Any framework that promises clarity is appealing
- Questioning the framework feels like abandoning the suffering

**Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study:**

**Full summary:** [articles/Cambridge-Somerville-Youth-Study.md](../articles/Cambridge-Somerville-Youth-Study.md)

- 506 boys, matched pairs, random assignment
- Treatment: counseling, mentorship, summer camp, caring adults
- 30-year result: treatment group had:
  - More criminal offending (2+ crimes)
  - More alcohol abuse
  - More mental illness symptoms
  - Lower occupational prestige
  - Lower job satisfaction
  - More stress disorders (high blood pressure, heart trouble)
  - **Earlier death** (premature mortality before 35)

Joan McCord: *"No one had ever discussed the possibility that intervention—where you're going to a family and you're offering help or you're sending children to summer camp... that there is any potential for harmful effects."*

*"Unless social programs are evaluated for potential harm as well as benefit, safety as well as efficacy, the choice of which social programs to use will remain a dangerous guess."*

**Also:** DARE (80% of schools, no effect), Scared Straight (kids did worse)

*"Caring isn't enough. Without measurement, caring can hurt."*

### E. Without Measurement, Social Dynamics Rule

- When concepts can't be tested, they spread based on:
  - Who promotes them
  - How they feel
  - What's socially safe to say
- Once belief sets in, questioning makes you a heretic
- Certain perspectives become untouchable—not because they're wrong, but because they're socially uncomfortable

**The blind spot:**
- Therapy profession attracts particular temperaments
- Default emphasis: accommodate, protect, align emotions, unconditional positive regard
- What gets ignored: autonomy, healthy challenge, hard truths
- Traditional perspectives that emphasize autonomy/accountability become unmentionable

*"Without objective frameworks, social comfort determines what's acceptable to discuss. And social comfort has blind spots."*

---

## V. THE PROPOSAL: Scientific Thinking + Family (13 min)

### Scientific Thinking Is the Antidote

- Scientific thinking = "What would have to be true for me to be wrong?"
- The willingness to be **falsified**
- Nobody in these historical cases asked: "What if we're making it worse?"

*"A field that doesn't ask 'what if we're wrong?' will eventually be wrong in catastrophic ways."*

### Why Measurability Matters

**The Common Currency Argument:**
- Everyone knows what a dollar is → global markets
- Without common currency → barter → no coordination
- Without measurable concepts → opinion vs. opinion → loudest voice wins

**Facts Calm People Down:**
- First move in family therapy: **gather facts**
- What is a fact? Something everyone can easily agree on
- Facts establish a **depolarized baseline**
- Without facts: tribal hierarchy → emotionally determined outcomes

*"Measurability provides a healthier way to reduce uncertainty than ideology. Facts calm people down without the catastrophic side effects."*

### The Blade of Grass

- Studying a blade of grass to understand why it bends
- Measuring angle, position, structure
- Still can't predict movement
- Because the grass isn't the phenomenon. **The wind is.**
- *"We've spent 80 years studying individuals. The pattern is in the system."*

### Why Family?

- Family is the smallest system where the pattern is visible
- Not society (too big, can't intervene)
- Not the individual (misses the pattern)
- One level up from the blade of grass

### What You'll Get Today

| Session | What You'll Get |
|---------|-----------------|
| **SARF** | Measurable concepts for family-level patterns—including "A" for anxiety |
| **AI Tools** | Technology to capture what we're learning to see |
| **App Demo** | Practical tools you can use Monday |
| **Clinical Case** | Evidence it works |

### The Call to Action

*"Before your next intake, draw the family."*

*"Before your next intervention, ask: how would I know if this is making things worse?"*

---

## VI. Q&A / CLARIFYING QUESTIONS (10 min)

Likely questions:
- "Are you saying therapy doesn't work?"
- "What about individual factors like genetics?"
- "How do I apply scientific thinking without being a researcher?"

## REFERENCE MATERIAL (Not in presentation, but available)

### Finnish Study (2024) — Evidence the "wind" is measurable

**Source:** [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/05/240523112604.htm)

- 700,000 ninth-graders tracked
- Classmates with mental disorders → **9-18%** increased risk for you
- Strongest for mood, anxiety, eating disorders
- *Exactly what you'd expect if the problem were in systems, not individuals.*

### Concept Creep

**Source:** [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11804130/)

- Mental health concepts have broadened over decades
- People holding broad concepts more likely to self-diagnose
- Groups most likely to self-diagnose: young adults, political progressives
- TikTok/Instagram: 60-second videos lead to self-diagnosis

### Attachment Theory Limitation

**[TODO: LOCATE CITATION]**

Study showing children with "secure" attachment present as disorganized if parents fight in laboratory. Implication: "style" is function of system state, not stable trait.
