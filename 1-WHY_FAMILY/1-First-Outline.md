## Core Thesis

**The One Sentence:** "The problem isn't inside your client."

**The Enemy:** The assumption that the problem lives inside the individual.

**The Smallest Viable Win:** "Before your next intake, draw the family."

---

## FIRST HALF: The Problem + The Proposal (~55-60 min)

### I. OPENING: The Engineer's Confession (5 min)

- Your story: engineer enters behavioral health field
- Expected: if it doesn't work, fix it or discard it
- Found: something else entirely
- *"I'm not here to attack anyone's training. I'm here to share what I've learned trying to make sense of a field that confused me."*

**Transition:** *"Let me show you what confused me."*

---

### II. FOUR UNCOMFORTABLE FACTS (15 min)

Present without editorializing. Let them land.

1. **The Treatment-Prevalence Paradox**
   - Treatment for depression increased **4x** from 1987-2007
   - Prevalence of depression: **stayed the same or increased**
   - *"More treatment does not mean less depression."*

2. **The Relapse Problem**
   - After first depression episode: 50% relapse
   - After second: 70% relapse. After third: **90% relapse**
   - 85% recurrence within a decade
   - *"The fire keeps getting relit."*

3. **The Youth Crisis**
   - Teen depression up **145%** (2010-2021)
   - Suicide deaths ages 10-24: up **62%** (2007-2021)
   - 1 in 5 high school students seriously considered suicide in 2023
   - More therapists, more spending, more awareness than ever
   - *"It's not working. Not even close."*

4. **The Institutional Collapse**
   - ~40% of psychology studies replicate
   - NIMH stopped funding DSM-only research (2013)
   - *"The largest funder of mental health research lost confidence in our diagnostic system."*

**Transition:** *"This isn't new. This pattern has been visible for a long time."*

---

### III. WHY IT'S NOT WORKING: Historical Patterns (15 min)

#### A. Social Contagion Has Always Existed

- Dancing Plague of 1518
- Salem Witch Trials (1692)
- Convent hysterias (15th-19th century)
- June Bug Epidemic (1962)
- TikTok Tics (2021) — first documented "mass social media-induced illness"
- *"Mental phenomena spread through systems. This is documented throughout history."*

#### B. Helping Can Hurt

**Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study (1939):**
- 506 boys, matched pairs, one gets intervention (counseling, mentorship, camp)
- 30-year follow-up: treatment group did WORSE
- More crime, more alcoholism, more mental illness, **earlier death**
- Joan McCord: "No one had ever discussed the possibility that intervention... has any potential for harmful effects."

**Scared Straight:**
- Exposed at-risk kids to prison inmates
- Result: "ineffective at best, appreciably harmful at worst"

**DARE:**
- Implemented in 80% of U.S. school districts
- Did not reduce drug use or even delay first use

*"Well-intentioned helping, informed by intuition rather than measurement, can make things worse."*

#### C. Therapy Fads and Concept Creep

- Hysteria → Schizophrenia → MPD → ADHD → Gender Identity Disorder
- Current fad: "Trauma" — everyone uses it, nobody can measure it
- Concept creep: mental health terms broaden until they mean everything (and nothing)
- TikTok self-diagnosis epidemic
- *"Without measurable definitions, concepts drift. Drift creates confusion. Confusion prevents coordination."*

**Transition:** *"So what's the blind spot? Why does this keep happening?"*

---

### IV. THE BLADE OF GRASS (10 min)

**The Metaphor:**
- Studying a blade of grass to understand why it bends
- Measuring angle, cellular structure, position
- Still can't predict movement
- Because the grass isn't the phenomenon. The wind is.
- *"We've spent 80 years studying blades of grass."*

**Connect to Their Experience:**
- "Client improves in session, falls apart at home"
- "Discharge a patient, see them again in 6 months" (85% within a decade)
- "Symptoms treated, but the fire keeps getting relit" (50/70/90% relapse rates)
- The implicit model: "The way you understand a problem determines what you do to solve it."
- *"You're not failing. You're solving the wrong problem."*

**The Core Claim:**
- *"The problem isn't inside your client."*
- The individual is the wrong unit of analysis
- Behavior that looks chaotic at the individual level shows patterns at the system level

**Evidence: The Finnish Study (2024)**
- 700,000 ninth-graders tracked
- Classmates with mental disorders → 9-18% increased risk for you
- *"Mental disorders spread through social networks."*

**Transition:** *"So what do we do about this?"*

---

### V. THE PROPOSAL: Shift the Unit of Analysis (10 min)

**Why Family? (Not Society)**
- Family is the smallest system where the wind is visible
- Not society (too big, too abstract), not the individual (too small, misses the pattern)
- One level up from the blade of grass

**Why Measurability Matters:**
- Common currency analogy: everyone knows what a dollar is → global markets
- Facts allow people to calm down
- Facts establish a depolarized baseline
- Without facts: opinion vs. opinion → tribal hierarchy → emotionally determined outcomes
- *"Facts calm people down."*

**Tease What's Coming:**
- *"After the break, I'll introduce six concepts that describe what you can see when you look at the family level."*
- *"These concepts are the 'R' in SARF — the relationship patterns that explain what we've been missing."*

---

## **--- BREAK (15 min) ---**

---

## SECOND HALF: Introduction to Bowen Concepts (~45-50 min)

### VI. WHY THESE CONCEPTS MATTER (5 min)

- These are not new — Bowen saw this 60+ years ago
- But now we have tools to measure it
- Six concepts, each describes observable patterns in family systems
- Think of these as the "moves" the wind makes

---

### VII. THE SIX CONCEPTS (35-40 min, ~6 min each)

#### 1. Differentiation of Self

The ability to maintain one's own emotional and intellectual functioning while remaining in contact with emotionally important people.

- Not isolation (that's cutoff)
- Not fusion (loss of self in togetherness)
- The capacity to be a self while being connected
- Scale: low differentiation = reactive; high differentiation = thoughtful under pressure

#### 2. Triangles

The basic molecule of emotional systems. When anxiety rises between two people, they pull in a third to stabilize.

- Universal pattern
- Interlocking triangles form the family emotional system
- Observable: watch who talks to whom about whom
- *"If you can see triangles, you can see the wind."*

#### 3. Nuclear Family Emotional System

Four patterns for managing anxiety in a nuclear family:
1. Marital conflict
2. Dysfunction in one spouse
3. Impairment of one or more children
4. Emotional distance

- These aren't choices — they're automatic
- Same anxiety, different outlets

#### 4. Family Projection Process

How parents transmit their emotional problems to a child:
1. Focus on the child as the problem
2. Interpret child's behavior through anxious lens
3. Treat child as if interpretation is accurate
4. Child responds to treatment, confirms interpretation

- Explains why one child in a family often does worse
- Not about parental intention — it's automatic

#### 5. Multigenerational Transmission Process

How patterns are transmitted across generations:
- Each generation produces individuals with higher and lower differentiation
- Lower differentiation individuals tend to marry similar
- Over generations, functioning can decline significantly
- Or rise, given different patterns

#### 6. Emotional Cutoff

Managing unresolved emotional issues with family by reducing or cutting off contact:
- Geographic distance
- Internal withdrawal while present
- Appears to solve the problem
- Actually intensifies it by reducing adaptive capacity
- *"The more you run, the less you have to work with."*

**What We're NOT Covering:**
- Sibling position (too much detail for now)
- Societal emotional process (too big; mention only as "context")

---

### VIII. CLOSE + Q&A (10 min)

**The Question:**
*"What if the reason we can't predict outcomes isn't that human behavior is unpredictable—but that we've been looking at the wrong level? What if the patterns are there, and we've just been too zoomed in to see them?"*

**The Call to Action:**
*"Before your next intake, draw the family."*

**What's Coming Next:**
- SARF model: A simplified framework for thinking about this systematically
- AI tools: How technology can help capture what we're learning to see
- App demo: Practical tools you can use

|-------|--------------|
| Paradigm terminology (positivism, etc.) | Too academic |
| Popper/Kuhn/falsification | Audience doesn't need it |
| Big Five / therapist personality | Risks alienating the room |
| Deep measurability argument | Save for SARF session |
| Detailed methodology critique | Dissertation is backup |
| RDoC details | Tangent for this audience |
| Sibling position | Too much detail |
| Societal emotional process | Too big; mention only as "context" |
| SARF details | That's the next presentation |
| App demo | That's the afternoon |
