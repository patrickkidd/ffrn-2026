## Script 1: Short Ad (< 60 seconds)

Hi, I'm Dr. Patrick Stinson, coming to you from Anchorage, Alaska. I'm an AI engineer and psychologist — by day I architect AI systems at a tech company, and the rest of the time I apply those same methods to a field that desperately needs them.

Here's the problem: treatment for depression has quadrupled over the last 20 years. The rate of depression hasn't moved. More therapists, more spending, more awareness than ever — and the numbers are getting worse.

Something is wrong with what we're measuring. The patterns driving these problems are biological and automatic — they predate the human species. And they're far more active between people in a family than anywhere else. That's where the signal is, and right now there's no scalable way to capture it.

On February 28th, I'm spending a full day with the Florida Family Research Network — the data, the variables, and the AI tools I'm building to try and measure what we've been missing.

I hope you'll join us.

## Script 2: Content Teaser (~100 seconds)

Hi, I'm Dr. Patrick Stinson, coming to you from Anchorage, Alaska. I'm an AI engineer and architect at Micron Technology, and I'm also a psychologist. That combination puts me in an unusual position — I spend my days building AI systems at scale, and my research applies those exact methods to behavioral health.

On February 28th I'll be presenting a full day for the Florida Family Research Network. Here's why.

Treatment for depression has quadrupled over the last two decades. Teen depression is up 145 percent. Suicide among young people, up 62 percent. Forty percent of psychology studies don't replicate. More resources than ever, and the numbers are getting worse.

Something is wrong with what we're measuring. The patterns behind these problems are biological and automatic — rooted in evolutionary relationship processes that vastly predate the human species. And that level of automaticity is far more active between people in a family than between people outside one. That's not a theoretical or philisophical preference — that's where the *signal* is strongest.

Now — there's no shortage of AI initiatives in behavioral health. But AI is only as good as the data you point it at. What's been missing are variables that reflect these deeper biological patterns, not just subjective self-report. That's what we're capturing.

I've built a data model for tracking symptoms, anxiety, relationships, and functioning over time. We're running an inter-rater reliability study — the same ground-truth pipeline behind every serious AI system — to verify that trained clinicians agree on what they're seeing in real clinical data. I generate synthetic clinical data to accelerate the cycle. I've built software tools to scale the work: a family diagram app for clinical professionals already in use, and an AI intake tool that conducts a structured family assessment through natural conversation.

This day will show you the science, the technology, and how to be part of what comes next.

I hope to see you there.
