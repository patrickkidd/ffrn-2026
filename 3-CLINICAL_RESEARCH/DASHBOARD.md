# Presentation 3: Clinical Research at the Cutting Edge

**FFRN Conference | Feb 28, 2025**
**Duration:** 45 minutes (11:15-12:00)

## Status

**Current state:** Slide deck at `3-SLIDES-IRR-AI-ERAS.md`. 23 slides, low resolution, room for discussion.

## Todo

- [x] Decide demo approach → No live demos. Screenshots sufficient.
- [x] Draft slide deck → `1-SLIDES-DRAFT.md` (19 slides, ~40 min content)
- [ ] Capture screenshot (IRR app interface)
- [ ] Decide on Bowen terminology usage (same decision as Presentation 2)
- [ ] Create actual slides (PowerPoint/Keynote/Google Slides)

## Purpose

A glimpse into how to research this stuff—and how we *are* researching it. Not a detailed technical walkthrough. Low resolution with room for questions and discussion.

## Core Message

**We built research infrastructure. We made discoveries. Here's where it leads.**

Technology scales what humans validate. Ground truth is human truth.

## Strategic Framing

**Technology is a means to an end, not the point.** The story is about how to research clinical evaluation.

**Ground truth dispels "machines taking over."** Domain experts set the standard. Software replicates what humans agreed on. Every output reviewable and correctable.

**Low resolution is intentional.** Don't get into nuts and bolts—we did it, here's what we learned. Leave room for questions.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Simple Explanation |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Big data vs. small data** | Our problem requires intelligent inference, not spreadsheets |
| **Ground truth** | What domain experts agreed on—humans set the standard |
| **IRR + AI** | The killer combo—AI needs IRR, IRR provides ground truth |
| **Two eras** | Era 1: AI learns from humans. Era 2: AI discovers new patterns |
| **Synthetic data** | Generated discussions for training; accelerates learning |
| **Mutual discovery** | Clinical interview isn't a survey; relationship affects data |
| **IRR** | Can multiple trained people agree on coding? |
| **Vertical alignment** | One data model serves coding, comparison, stats, and scaling |
| **Real-time coding** | Stream of changes enables coding while interviewing |

## Discoveries to Highlight

1. **Mutual discovery requirement** — Can't just survey for this data like a knee problem. Therapist must explore *with* the client or you don't get all the data.

2. **Synthetic data trains faster** — Working group learned SARF coding faster on synthetic data than real cases. Real recordings are the goal; synthetic accelerates getting there.

## Key Sources

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `../resources/SARF-White-Paper.md` | SARF definition, R&D roadmap |
| `../articles/Stinson-Emotional-Systems-Research-Methodology.md` | Research methodology, IRR discussion |

## Outline Snapshots

| File | Status |
|------|--------|
| `0-INITIAL_BRAINSTORM.md` | Brainstorm and concepts |
| `1-SLIDES-DRAFT.md` | First draft - 19 slides |
| `2-SLIDES-VERTICAL-ALIGNMENT.md` | Added vertical alignment + getting involved |
| `3-SLIDES-IRR-AI-ERAS.md` | **Current** - 23 slides, punched slide 2, IRR+AI combo, two eras |

## Key Lines

- "Ground truth is human truth"
- "The machines don't decide what's correct. Humans do."
- "Technology scales. Humans validate."
- "If you just interrogate, you don't get the data you need."
- "Just seeing the data organized was the breakthrough."

## What to Show

- IRR app screenshot (one is enough)
- Keep it simple—infrastructure exists, we built it

## Tools to Promote

- **Pro App:** Released — timeline + diagram
- **Personal App:** In development — structured intake
- **IRR System:** In use — research infrastructure

## Connection to Day's Arc

**Presentation 1 (Why Family):** The field is broken, no measurement
**Presentation 2 (SARF Intro):** Here's a minimal framework
**Presentation 3 (This one):** Here's how to actually research it
